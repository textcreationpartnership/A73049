            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Vnder the Lawe, MiniÅ¿ters vvere propagated by GeneratiÃ¶; vnder the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel they are propagated by Ordination; therefore vvhere MiniÅ¿ters vvant to be diÅ¿tributed to due Offices, the Kinge is Gods MiniÅ¿ter to conÅ¿treine (if neede be) the MiniÅ¿ter vvho hath povver of Ordination, to ordeine MiniÅ¿ters for needefull offices. Such eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall MiniÅ¿ters therefore, as God by his vvoorde preÅ¿erved in Scripture, giues us light &amp; vvarrant for that they ought to be in the Church, vve may petition your MajeÅ¿tie that they be ordeined and diÅ¿tributed to their appointed Offices, if our Cleargy in vvhom is the povver of Ordination be herein negligent. True it is, that this Church hath bene very happy, in its preÅ¿ervinge in the Reformation, Arch-BiÅ¿hops, BiÅ¿hops, PreiÅ¿ts, and Deacons: and vve of theiÅ¿e tymes are herein likevviÅ¿e happy, that Å¿uch are continued in this Church vvith your MajeÅ¿ties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious allovvance; therefore I am not in this Chapter to petition for the ordeyninge of Å¿uch MiniÅ¿ters.

                  </p>
                  <p>THoÅ¿e eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Officers which I accoumpt to wante unto our Church, are, Lay Elders or Governours in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ParriÅ¿h Church, who, with, though under the Cleargy in that Church, Å¿hould Governe the Church in that ParriÅ¿h. But becauÅ¿e theiÅ¿e are not onely not as yet admitted in this Church, but alÅ¿o are by our Cleargy comtemptuouÅ¿ly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of, and Å¿poaken againÅ¿t, therefore I humbly pray, that I may, firÅ¿t, Å¿hew by the vvord of God in Scripture, that God Orderned Å¿uch in the Church: and Å¿econdly, that I may anÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were Å¿ome queÅ¿tions which may be moved concerning Å¿uch.</p>
                  <p>The ApoÅ¿tle S. Paule, 1. Cor. 12, 28, Å¿aith thus: And God hath ordeined Å¿ome in the Church, as firÅ¿t ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿econdly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, then them that doe Miracles: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the guifts of healinge, Helpers, Governours, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itie of tongues. From vvhich Scripture appeares, that by Gods Ordinance there vvere in thoÅ¿e time Governours in the Church, which both were inferior to Teachers, and alÅ¿o were not Teachers. That they were to be inferior to Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers appeares, in that they are ranked in order farr under Teachers: for as Teachers here rancked under ApoÅ¿tles in Order, were doubtleÅ¿s inferior to ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿o theiÅ¿e Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thus rancked under Teachers in Order, were inferior to Teachers. And that they were not Teachers may appeare, in that, verÅ¿e, 29, the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith: Are all ApoÅ¿tles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? for this manner interrogation of the ApoÅ¿tles proves, that as all Teachers were not ApoÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Å¿o thoÅ¿e named after Teachers were not Teachers. And indeede why Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, are all Teachers? if it miply not, that thoÅ¿e which follow Teachers were not to be Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150735:6"/>I conclude therefore from this Scripture, that it was Gods owne Ordinance, that there Å¿hould be in the Church a Å¿orte of Governours beÅ¿ides Teachers, and which might not be Teachers.</p>
                  <p>To this wee may add yet a further evidence for this, which we have by another portion of Scripture, as, 1. Tim. 5, 17, where we thus reade: The Elders that Rule well, are worthie of double Honour: Å¿pecially they that labour in the vvorde and Doctrine. Where, the ApoÅ¿tle not proceedinge from Teachinge to labouringe in Teachinge, but from Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge to labouringe in the vvorde, this argues undeniably, that Å¿ome for Rulinge vvell onely, were worthy of double Honor, For when the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, The Elders that Rule well are vvorthie of double Honour, who cann deny double honor to theiÅ¿e if they onely Ruled vvell, and Taught not at all? Therefore I cannot but conclude, that in thoÅ¿e times there vvere Governours in the Church, who for Rulinge well onely, though they laboured not in the vvorde, were worthy of double Honor. And indeede if here we Å¿hould take the conÅ¿truction which Å¿ome make of this Å¿peach, wher they Å¿ay, that here the ApoÅ¿tle meanes that all theiÅ¿e Elders are Teachers, and that he Å¿pecially commends Å¿ome of them for labouringe, or taking more paines in the vvorde then others tooke then it would followe firÅ¿t, that not for Ruling well onely Å¿ome were to have double Honor, (which thing is directly againÅ¿t this Scripture): Å¿econdly that Å¿ome Teachers were worthy of double honor for Rulinge well onely, though they Taught not at all; but this were an error not to be conceaved in the ApoÅ¿tle, Å¿eing not to Teach but onely Rule, is in a Teacher or Preacher of the GhoÅ¿pell, Å¿uch a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of a very Å¿peciall Duty, as that Å¿uch Teacher is worthy rather of Reproofe and PuniÅ¿hment then of double Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Moreover, if the ApoÅ¿tle would have us underÅ¿tande,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150735:6"/>that Å¿ome Teachers are worthy of double Honor for Rulinge well, but Å¿pecially Å¿uch as labour more painefully in Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge, then it had benefit he Å¿hould have Å¿aid: ThoÅ¿e El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that teach and Rule well, are worthy of double Honor: Å¿pecially they that labour in the vvord more then others: for verily, it is an unfit Å¿kippinge from Rulinge, to a degree of CompariÅ¿on in Teachinge LaÅ¿tly, Å¿eing Preachinge is a labour, the ApoÅ¿tle might well Å¿ay, Å¿pecially they that labour and yet without making uÅ¿e of any compariÅ¿on betweene them and other Teachers; neither indeede cann it be Å¿aid, that any one that Teacheth at all, laboureth not in the worde and Doctryne. TheiÅ¿e things conÅ¿idered, we have good warrant from this Scripture to collect and affirme: That in aÅ¿much as none may deny but that by this Å¿peach, Å¿ome were to have double Honour though they Ruled well onely: And in aÅ¿much as no Teacher but deÅ¿ervs reproofe if he Rule well onely and Teach not; Therefore here is an evidence, That the ChriÅ¿tian Church was to have in it Elders, who were not to be Teachers but Rulers onely. This evidence from Å¿acred Scripture for Å¿uch Governours conÅ¿idered, how cann any Å¿afely oppoÅ¿e the worke of one of the Å¿peciall Angells of the Reformation, even Calvin, in his reÅ¿toringe Å¿uch to the Church of God? DoubtleÅ¿s a Å¿peciall Act of a Å¿peciall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Reformation, is no Å¿male bond unto the reÅ¿t of the Churches Reformed, Å¿pecially when it hath this Light from Scripture, of the correÅ¿pondence thereof to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, in the firÅ¿t and ApoÅ¿tolically planted Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Thus having proved, that Governours who were not Teachers, were yet ordeined by God to be in the Church, I now pray that I may proceede, to anÅ¿wer certaine queÅ¿tions, which may by Å¿ome be moved co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap> Å¿uch Governours.</p>
                  <p>Some may Å¿ay: If theiÅ¿e were then in the Church, yet, is there any neceÅ¿Å¿ity that Å¿uch Å¿hould be now alÅ¿o in our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150735:7"/>Church? I anÅ¿were, Though all Officers and Offices which we fynde by Scripture to have bene in the Church, be not neceÅ¿Å¿arily to be now alÅ¿o in our tymes in the Church, (for vve read of ApoÅ¿tles, Prophets to foretell things, alÅ¿o of vvorkers of Miracles, Speakers of Tongues, Interpreters of Tongues, &amp;c: all which being by extraordinary Guifts of the Spirit, the Guift failinge, the Office and Officer faileth alÅ¿o) yet, Å¿uch Offices as might be executed vvithout Å¿uch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts, vvere to be continued in the Church. And indeede vvhy have vve Arch-BiÅ¿hops, BiÅ¿hops, PreiÅ¿ts, and Deacons, if not becauÅ¿e Å¿uch were ordeyned in the firÅ¿t plantation of the Church, and might be continued by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination vvithout any Neede of any extraordinary Guifts of the Spirit? As therefore vve are neceÅ¿Å¿arily to follow the example of Gods Ordinance in the beginning for theiÅ¿e, Å¿o the Å¿ame example is a bond, for the Churches havinge in it alÅ¿o Å¿uch Governours as now I vvrite of. To conclude, as in the Reformation we retayne Å¿uch Cleargy and Offices, as which have Å¿ome evidence in holy Scripture to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods Ordinance in the Church in the firÅ¿t tymes, Å¿o this evidence in Scripture for Governours who are not to be Teachers, ought to be a bond to the Church, to reÅ¿tore this Ordinance of God to the Church in the Reformation made. For Å¿einge vve followe not Tradition vvithout Å¿ome evidence in Scripture for other Offices of our Cleargy, vve ought not to followe the corruption and neglect of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, againÅ¿t the Scriptures light yeilded us for Å¿uch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours as now I vvrite. Let us not therefore kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t Gods Ordinance: Let us not deÅ¿piÅ¿e it as a neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s thinge: Let us not bringe downe viÅ¿itations upon us for Å¿uch neglect: Let us not Å¿ay all is already vvell Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, vvhen yet Å¿uch Governours are not in our Church; but rather let us meekely beare the yoake of this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150735:7"/>Ordinance of God alÅ¿o, that Å¿o our people and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may hereby be the more ChriÅ¿tianly Governed. Cann vve thinke that the Neglect of Å¿uch an Ordinance of God, vvill not breede a defect in the vvell Governinge of the Church? DoubtleÅ¿s, as all the Ordinances of God rended to the furtherance of the GhoÅ¿pells out Å¿preadinge, and well Governinge them converted by the GhoÅ¿pell, Å¿o where Å¿o Å¿peaciall an Ordinance is omitted, as is this of plantinge Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours vvho are not Teachers, there, both the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vvill the leÅ¿s prevaile, and the people alÅ¿o vvill be the more negligent, to bringe fourth the fruicts thereof in their life and converÅ¿ation. Doe but looke upon the difference of people, and effect of the GhoÅ¿pell, vvhere Å¿uch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are, and vvhere they are not reÅ¿tored, and by the evidence vvhich experience yeilds, be moved to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Benefit of reÅ¿toringe this Ordinance of the Lords.</p>
                  <p>Againe Å¿ome may Å¿ay: <hi>How have theiÅ¿e failed all this tyme?</hi> To this alÅ¿o I anÅ¿were, It is indeede uncertaine hovv; but yet, Å¿einge vve fynde by the vvorde of God that by Gods Ordinance Å¿uch vvere planted in the Church, vve have good cauÅ¿e to Beleeve, that by Å¿ome corruption of Tradition they failed. For my parte, I conceave, That Å¿oone after the ApoÅ¿tles tymes, the Church converted all Church Officers into Cleargy, and by makinge all Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the uÅ¿e of Lay Governours falled. Moreover, the convertinge them into Cleargy, might occaÅ¿ion that they were not founde in after tyme in every Church, becauÅ¿e of the inÅ¿upportable burthen of every Church or Congregations maintayninge of its Charge many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons.</p>
                  <p>Againe Å¿ome may Å¿ay: <hi>Are they then to be Lay Men?</hi> I anÅ¿were, yes; for if God exempt not any as for his Cleargy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150735:8"/>from labouringe for their owne Meanes, but Å¿uch as Preach the GhoÅ¿pell, none who are not Preachers of the GhoÅ¿pell are may be accoumpted Cleargy; But theÅ¿e (as before I have proved) were not to be Teachers or Preachers of the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, therefore they were not to be of the Cleargy, but of the Laiety. And that none but thoÅ¿e who Preach the GhoÅ¿pell, exempted as Gods Cleargy from labour, may appeare by that which the ApoÅ¿tle, 1. Cor. 9, 14 Å¿aith, in theiÅ¿e wordes: So alÅ¿o hath the Lord Ordeined, that they which Preach the GhoÅ¿pell Å¿hould live of the GhoÅ¿pell. And verÅ¿e, 6, he Å¿aith: Or I onely and Barnabas, have not we power not to worke? who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Where we Å¿ee, that it is the MiniÅ¿tration of the GhoÅ¿pell, that conferrs upon any this Priviledge, that he is not to worke for his livinge, but is to be maintayned of the Charge of Gods People. Now Cleargy is as much as Gods Lot, Å¿et apart to be maintayned of the Charge of Gods people, for the Service they do to God for others; therefore none but Å¿uch may be accoumpted Gods Cleargy. Moreover, if the ApoÅ¿tle argue for this Priviledge from any ones Preaching the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, how Å¿hall we vvarrantably eaÅ¿e our Å¿elvs, of that rabble of PopiÅ¿h Cleargy, which by corruption of Tradition Popery would thruÅ¿t upon us if we underÅ¿tande not the ApoÅ¿tle here, that onely they who feede the flock by Preaching, are to be accoumpted for Cleargy? If it be now obiected, that Deacons are Cleargy, and yet Deacons Preach not untill they be licenÅ¿ed, then I anÅ¿wer, That Deacons may be reÅ¿treyned, not for that they may not Preach by right, but for that they Å¿hould firÅ¿t be tried and proved, leaÅ¿t being yonge Students they preach evell Doctryne through ignorance. And indeede we fyndinge in Scripture, that Deacons remayninge Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were Preachers, Acts, 6, 8, and, 8, 5, vve may vvell Å¿ay that Deacons as Deacons have right to Preach. But here
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150735:8"/>vve fynde Governours who are not to be Teachers; therefore theiÅ¿e cannot claime the Priviledge of Cleargy as may Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>
                  <p>I conclvde therefore, that Å¿eing Gods Cleargy is as his Lot to be maintayned at the Charge of his People: and Å¿eing the ApoÅ¿tle claimes this for Preachinge the vvord, therefore theiÅ¿e Governours not being to be Teachers, have no right to be of the Cleargy, but are to be Lay Elders.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Å¿ome may Å¿ay: But muÅ¿t Å¿uch be in every ParriÅ¿h Church? I anÅ¿wer, yes: For Acts 14, 23. we reade thus: And when they had ordeyned them Elders by Election in every Church, they commended them to the Lord in whom they Beleeved; if then in every Church there were ordeyned a plurality of Elders, Å¿afeÅ¿t it is to have many Elders in every Church. Moreover, Å¿einge here it is Å¿aid that Elders (imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge many) were ordeyned in every Church: and Å¿eing vve have before proved, that in thoÅ¿e tymes there were in the Church, Elders who onely Ruled, and taught not: and Å¿eing it is not likely that the ApoÅ¿tle, would Å¿o Å¿oone Charge every Church with many Cleargy; therefore moÅ¿t likely it is, that theiÅ¿e Elders vvere many, being parte Cleargy for Rulinge and Teachinge, parte Lay Elders Å¿erving Å¿o, Rule onely. And indeede, Å¿eing the ApoÅ¿tle commended the Churches to the Lord, it argues, that he had furniÅ¿hed them with Å¿uch Elders, as in thoÅ¿e tymes vvere ordeyned by God to be in the Church; but I have before proved, that God ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Governours who were not Teachers, aÅ¿well as Teachers who alÅ¿o Governed; therefore we may not thinke, that the ApoÅ¿tle left theiÅ¿e Churches defective in either of theiÅ¿e. Furthermore, Å¿eing every Congregation is neceÅ¿Å¿arily to have a Teaching Elder, (for, Å¿hould a flock be without a Shephearde) every Congregation is likewiÅ¿e to have Å¿uch Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Officers as are under Teachers; for though every

                  <p>To conclude, Å¿einge a ParriÅ¿h Church cannot be denied to be a church, therefore neceÅ¿Å¿arily it ought to have in it, as Elders to Teach, Å¿o Elders to Rule onely: for the defect in either of theiÅ¿e, would Å¿urely produce a defect in the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of the Å¿ame. For this cauÅ¿e we may not content our Å¿elvs with our Civill Lavvyers onely, Å¿einge they are not in every Church, but onely in the whole church of a BiÅ¿hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in the BiÅ¿hops courte onely. Neither may we take our Church vvardens and Side Men for theiÅ¿e Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Å¿einge they have not Power of Iudgement and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment; vvhereas Goverment is lame of one hand if it have not this Power. Surely therefore, accordinge to Gods Ordinance, every church which hath any Elders in it, is to have a Goverment by Elders, but Governinge implies power of Iudginge and PuniÅ¿hinge, therefore every church is to have this power in it, as it vvill not be defective in its Goverment. Verily, if we looke upon our people in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, obÅ¿ervinge their life and converÅ¿ation in every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h, vve may well Å¿ay that here vvants the Goverment in overy ParriÅ¿h which here we Å¿ee the Lord ordeined For, our people for the moÅ¿t parte, contentinge themÅ¿elves to come to church onely, and Å¿atisfye the Lawe by hearinge Divine Service and the vvorde Preached, never make conÅ¿cience of livinge alÅ¿o thereafter, and this for vvant of feeling neere them the Power of this PariÅ¿hionall Goverment. For vvhilÅ¿t at home in their ParriÅ¿h they may uÅ¿e unchriÅ¿tian Liberty in their actions and Talks, Å¿o long as they keepe themÅ¿elvs from Å¿o offendinge, as that the Lawe takes hold of them, our people are mervailous careleÅ¿s of obÅ¿ervinge in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150735:10"/>their Å¿peach, the holy reÅ¿treinte of the GhoÅ¿pell. But if they Å¿awe neere them in their owne ParriÅ¿h, a Teacher, and a Deacon, for Cleargy, and Å¿ome of their Neighbours of the Laiety, havinge Power to call the diÅ¿orderly to Accoumptes, and to PuniÅ¿h them who live not as the GhoÅ¿pell requires, then, what with the neereneÅ¿s of the obÅ¿ervinge eyes of theÅ¿e Governours, and what with the Å¿ence of their power to Iudge &amp; PuniÅ¿h them, if they obÅ¿erve not the GhoÅ¿pell in their life and ConverÅ¿ation, a holy Awe would fall upon Gods people in every ParriÅ¿h, cauÅ¿inge an abÅ¿tayninge from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eemely Acts and ConverÅ¿ation. And this much the rather, becauÅ¿e theiÅ¿e Governours dwellinge here and there among them, they are neere in every quarter of the ParriÅ¿h, to have knowledge of Å¿uch as make no conÅ¿cience to live and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e as beÅ¿eemeth ChriÅ¿tians. Therefore aÅ¿well for the utility to Gods people, which vvould ariÅ¿e by the havinge in every ParriÅ¿h, diverÅ¿e of the Antient, godly, and honeÅ¿t of the Laiety, to Governe in the ParriÅ¿h, as for this evidence from Scripture, that Å¿uch vvere ordeined in every Church, we Å¿hould be moved to receave willingely, the ordeyning of Å¿uch in every ParriÅ¿h Church. If it be obiected, <hi>that here every City, not every Church is meant,</hi> then I anÅ¿were, That in thoÅ¿e tymes it is likely, that Å¿ome Cityes had but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and beinge Å¿o, then to Å¿ay of them, every City, or every Church, is to one effect; neither truly is it likely, that Å¿o Å¿oone every City affoorded many Churches. Moreover, Å¿einge it was Churches, not Cityes, that were to be thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we are rather to underÅ¿tande every Church, then every City for theiÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons I conclude, that it is Å¿afeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t proffitable, that every ParriÅ¿h-Church have ordeyned in it, Lay Elders to Governe onely, aÅ¿well as Cleargy Elders, who both are to Teach and Governe. If it be Å¿aid, <hi>that every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h-Church havinge Cleargy Elders, as, a Teacher or PaÅ¿tor, and a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150735:11"/>Deacon, then thus Scripture makes nothinge for Lay Elders,</hi> then to this I anÅ¿were, That Å¿einge there is evidence, that in thoÅ¿e tymes there were Elders which Ruled and Taught, and Elders which Ruled onely and taught not, therefore fitteÅ¿t it is, that here we underÅ¿tande not a plurality of Cleargy Elders onely, but rather parte Cleargy part Laiety.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Å¿ome may Å¿ay, <hi>How many muÅ¿t they be in Number?</hi> I anÅ¿were, Å¿einge we reade of Elders ordeyned, without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge alÅ¿o any Å¿et Number, therefore the Church is not bounde to obÅ¿erve any Å¿et or certaine Number. As the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h therefore is more or leÅ¿s in circuit of grounde or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tety of people, Å¿o theiÅ¿e Governours may be more or Å¿ewer: for where a ParriÅ¿h is narrow of boundes, though it conteyn much people, yet three or fower of theiÅ¿e Governours may Å¿erve, Å¿einge they are neere in neighbourhood to every one of the ParriÅ¿h; whereas where the ParriÅ¿he is large of circuit, there it is needefull that they be Å¿even or eight, to the end that their dwellinge may be here and there, to be neere to thoÅ¿e of the ParriÅ¿h in every quarter to obÅ¿erve them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Å¿ome may Å¿ay, <hi>What is their Office?</hi> I anÅ¿were, Å¿einge they are called Governours and Rulers, and yet inferior to Teachers, it implies, that they, with, though under the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of a ParriÅ¿h, Å¿hould Governe the people of the ParriÅ¿h. And Å¿einge Goverment is lame, where Power of Iudginge &amp; PuniÅ¿hinge is wantinge, therefore, (as vve would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave the Lord to give a Lame Ordinance to his Church) we are to Beleeve, that theiÅ¿e Governours Å¿hould aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the Cleargy, in Iudginge and PuniÅ¿hinge with eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hments, Å¿uch in the ParriÅ¿h, as obÅ¿erve not the GhoÅ¿pell in their life and converÅ¿ation. If here it be obiected, <hi>that then I make them: Ministers of the Å¿ame Power in bindinge and looÅ¿inge, as the Lord committed to the Cleargy onely;</hi> I anÅ¿were, No; for there is difference betwixt byndinge and looÅ¿inge the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150735:11"/>Å¿inne its Å¿elfe, and inflictinge or releaÅ¿inge of PuniÅ¿hments: there is difference betweene byndinge a Man in his Å¿inne, or looÅ¿inge him from it, and puniÅ¿hinge a Man with eccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall PuniÅ¿hments for offences, or releaÅ¿inge him from the the Å¿ame. And indeede, the worde is, Iohn, 20, 23: <hi>WhoÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evers Å¿innes ye remit, whoÅ¿oevers Å¿innes yee retayne;</hi> not whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever PuniÅ¿hment you inflict or remit; therefore in the firÅ¿t of theiÅ¿e the Cleargy onely have Power, but in the Å¿econd, the mixt Elders of the Church, aÅ¿well the Lay as Cleargy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have Power. When the inceÅ¿tuous Corinthian was to be excommunicated, the ApoÅ¿tle commits this to a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality rather then to any one, 1. Cor. 5, 13: <hi>Put away ther fore from amonge your Å¿elvs that wicked Man;</hi> And in the remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion or AbÅ¿olution he doth the like, 2. Cor. 2, 7: <hi>Ye ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forgive him.</hi> To conclude then, TheiÅ¿e Lay Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Office is, to joyne with the Cleargy of the ParriÅ¿h in obÅ¿ervinge thoÅ¿e of the ParriÅ¿h, whither they live and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e as beÅ¿eemeth Saincts, and where any are faulty, there to judge of the crime, &amp; to proceede againÅ¿t them as the cauÅ¿e requireth. If theiÅ¿e Governours offend in their Goverment, whither by Negligence, or by untymely Severity, or diÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceedings, they have over them the BiÅ¿hop &amp; Arch-BiÅ¿hop, who are to call them to Accoumpt, and to puniÅ¿h them alÅ¿o for any evell adminiÅ¿tration of their office; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alÅ¿o Å¿o much the rather Å¿uch Governours may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in every Church and Kingedome, and not oppoÅ¿ed as in theiÅ¿e tymes, as for a dangerous rabble of rude and turbulent BuÅ¿y-Bodies. Neither indeede may any be Å¿uffered to Rule contrary to the GhoÅ¿pell, who have their office by the GhoÅ¿pell, therefore if PaÅ¿tors and BiÅ¿hops muÅ¿t be, 2.

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:150735:13"/>Governours be like minded? For if Goverment and IuÅ¿tice be not hindred by this lenity in PaÅ¿tors and BiÅ¿hops, why Å¿hould this preiudice the Å¿ame, if theiÅ¿e Governours doe likewiÅ¿e? And if Timothie muÅ¿t not <hi>receave an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation againÅ¿t an Elder, but under two or three witneÅ¿Å¿es, I. Tim. 5, 19,</hi> much leÅ¿s muÅ¿t theiÅ¿e inferior Governours, hand over head trouble Men, upon every reporte they heare, or Å¿uÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have. And if the Elders of the Church be Å¿o to be reÅ¿pected, are not the Elders of the Kingedome, even Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and MagiÅ¿trates to be likewiÅ¿e Å¿o reÅ¿pected? As God ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the Elders of the Church, that every reporte, or every little evidence of evell, Å¿hall not be preÅ¿ently taken hold of to their diÅ¿grace, Å¿o we may well thinke that even Å¿uch his will is alÅ¿o, concerning the Civill MagiÅ¿trats of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; therefore the Governours of the Church ought to be Å¿lowe in medling with Å¿uch. S. Peter alÅ¿o, 1. Pet 5, 3, chargeth the Elders Church, <hi>that not as though they were Lords over Gods heretage,</hi> they Å¿hould Governe the Å¿ame. WhilÅ¿t this bridle therefore is put into the mouthes of theiÅ¿e Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and this alÅ¿o by the Ordinance of God, theiÅ¿e Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours neede not Å¿o to be oppoÅ¿ed as Å¿ome would have it, under pretence that they woulde prove in the Kingdome, a Å¿orte of ignorant Men, puffed up by this Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and troublers of men upon every the leaÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion. True it is, that we muÅ¿t underÅ¿tande, that as the Kingedome, Å¿o the Church, may not Å¿o pervert IuÅ¿tice, as not to lay hold on them that Å¿inne openly; therefore where there is an open Å¿inninge theiÅ¿e may not be timerous, vnder coulour of Å¿ufferinge the evell men patiently. Yea, I Å¿ay more, vvhen it is hearde certainely abroade, (as was that 1. Cor. 5, 1.) that Å¿uch or Å¿uch a Man is a Drunkarde, a whore mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter, fornicator, Adulterer, extortioner, Railer, filthy Å¿peaker, or the like, Å¿uch fame or report muÅ¿t not be neglected, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150735:13"/>rather muÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion a watchinge over Å¿uch, and when dut AccuÅ¿ation Å¿hall Å¿econde the Reporte, then may they no neglect to proceede againÅ¿t Å¿uch. To this I may add as a parte of their care and Goverment, that they Å¿ee the Church decently kept, and the Congregation ordered in fit manner, aÅ¿well for order in Å¿ittinge, as for perfourmance of Å¿uch Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as Å¿erue to expreÅ¿s Reverence at Divine Service. In a vvorde, they are to Å¿ee that Men live and converÅ¿e, as the ordinance of the GhoÅ¿pell, together with the Churches Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons (not diÅ¿Å¿onant from the GhoÅ¿pells ordinances) require. Surely the Benefit of Å¿uch Lay Governours in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation woulde be greate; for by their Elderly Gravity of yeares, and Authority which Å¿uch kinde of ElderÅ¿hipp onely carries with it: &amp; by the plurality of their Number, and their dwellinge in Å¿everall parts of the ParriÅ¿h, not onely an Awe of them would fall upon them of that Congregation, but alÅ¿o a certainety of crimes would the Å¿ooner be attayned, Å¿o that men could hardly live longe diÅ¿orderly, but they would be knowen Å¿o to doe to Å¿ome or other of theiÅ¿e Governours. Moreover, by Å¿uch Governours our people would be bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Churches State and MaieÅ¿ty would be increaÅ¿ed; for our people Å¿einge that the Antient amonge them, have Authority even by Gods Ordinance, to obÅ¿erve, Governe, Iudge, &amp; puniÅ¿h them, they wil be the more carefull to live &amp; converÅ¿e as beÅ¿eemeth ChriÅ¿tians: And the church havinge the Antient of the Laiety in every CongregatiÃ¶, joyned with the Cleargy in the Goverment of the churche, &amp; Å¿ervinge as Governours inferior to the Cleargy, the State &amp; Authority of the church would greately be augmented To conclude then, if God Å¿ent out the GhoÅ¿pell accompanied with this kinde of goveruours alÅ¿o, (which thing I have before proved from the Scriptures) cann we expect any other then detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea &amp; puniÅ¿hme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, if we deny to admit Å¿uch governours;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150735:14"/>Shall not our Land and Kingedome Å¿uffer viÅ¿itations, for the Neglect and OppoÅ¿inge of Å¿o holy and neceÅ¿Å¿ary an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God? Shall the GhoÅ¿pell be admitted, and its Goverment kept out? or cann we expect proffit by the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell if thus vve doe? For doubleÅ¿s Iudgements accompany the GhoÅ¿pell, where the Government ordeyned to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it will not be admitted. For the avoidinge of Gods judgements therefore, and for the betteringe of our people, yea for the augmentation of the State and MajeÅ¿ty of our Church of Englande, let theiÅ¿e Lay Elders be admitted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Rule and Goverment. To this I may add, that as common experience Å¿hews, the puttinge Offices of Power and goverment into Mens hands, maketh them growe in kuowledge of the Lawes, and carefull of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Å¿o Å¿urely the puttinge this EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Power and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment into the Elders of the Laiety, would both occaÅ¿ion their Å¿earch more diligently into the worde of God, thereby to increaÅ¿e their knowledge of the Divine will, and alÅ¿o their carefull taking heede unto their Manners, that they give not offence to them whom they are to governe. Yea the yonger Men alÅ¿o in every ParriÅ¿h, Å¿einge the Credit &amp; honor of Å¿uch place of government, would Å¿tudy the Scriptures, and take care of their Manners, that Å¿o they may attaine a fame or good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte for their honeÅ¿ty and Piety, Å¿o to be the fitter to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in Å¿uch Office of goverment as their turnes may come.</p>
                  <p>LaÅ¿tly, Å¿ome may Å¿ay, <hi>MuÅ¿t theiÅ¿e beinge once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this Office, ever remaine in this Office, and not be imploied in other Offices of the Kingedome?</hi> I anÅ¿were, firÅ¿t, that there is greate difference betweene the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tration of the worde, and the MiniÅ¿tration of government onely; the firÅ¿t is not to be left off; the Å¿econd may without offence: For the vvorde of God hath laide no Å¿uch bond on
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150735:14"/>this as on that. Secondly, Å¿einge it would be an inÅ¿ufferable miÅ¿cheife unto Kingedomes, if many of the Elders thereof in every ParriÅ¿h, Å¿hould be wholy exempted from its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in Offices needefull thereunto, therefore we may not conceave, that the Lord would Å¿end Å¿uch a Goverment eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall into them, as which Å¿hould bringe with it Å¿uch an inconvenience and miÅ¿cheife. I conclude therefore, that theiÅ¿e Lay Governours are not bounde by the Lord, to continue ever in their Office, but now may Å¿erve in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of the Church, and another tyme not.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I (Dread Soveraigne) bene the more prolixe in my wrytinge of theiÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e this our Church of England doth hitherto rather oppoÅ¿e then admit of Å¿uch; but now havinge Å¿howen from the vvorde of God, that of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance Å¿uch a kynde of Governours or Rulers are to be in the Church; I humbly petition your MajeÅ¿tie, that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande our Cleargy in whom is the Power to confert eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iaÅ¿ticall Powers and Offices, that they exerciÅ¿e their Power herein, ordeyninge Å¿ome of the antient and godly of the Laiety, to this Power and Authority in every of our ParriÅ¿h Churches. So Å¿hall you Å¿urely doe a vvorke, acceptable to God, beneficiall to the Church, and worthy of that great Name which you have raiÅ¿ed to your Å¿elfe in the Churches of God. Suffer therefore patiently I humbly pray you, this my petition for the admiÅ¿Å¿ion of theiÅ¿e kynde of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Governours, that Å¿o the Officers eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, may be wholy found in this our Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande. I grante that many other Offices may be ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church, as the Change of tymes, increaÅ¿e of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence of Gods Divine Service, and other like things may occaÅ¿ion; but theiÅ¿e before written of are Å¿uch as may not be omitted, becauÅ¿e they have evidence from the vvorde of God, to by the Ordinance of God ApoÅ¿tolically delivered;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150735:15"/>therefore alÅ¿o the Cleargy in whom is the power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are of duty bounde to renewe this Ordinance of the Lords in the Church.

                        <hi>2. PETITION:</hi> That PariÅ¿hes, BiÅ¿hopdomes, and Arch-BiÅ¿hopdomes, may be conveniently bounded.</head>
                     <p>SOme of our PariÅ¿hes are Å¿o Å¿mall, and withall conteyne in them Å¿o few people, that neither the Congregation beareth a State befittinge a Church, nor yet cann a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Meanes or Revenewe be raiÅ¿ed therefrom for a PaÅ¿tor and Deacon his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant; And on the contrary, Å¿ome other PariÅ¿hes retayninge their very antient boundes, conteyne now (by Gods multiplyinge the people in that place) Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, that al cannot at one time conveniently aÅ¿Å¿emble in the church. I therefore petition, that the Å¿maller be made larger, and thoÅ¿e which are too large may be divided, that Å¿o neither Gods MiniÅ¿ters be diÅ¿couraged, by the Å¿male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of Revenewe or Meanes of life, nor Gods people diÅ¿hartened from comminge to Church, through want of convenient place, when they come there. Some PariÅ¿hes alÅ¿o abounde with Å¿trangers, who are but lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for a time, yet in Å¿uch places proviÅ¿ion were good to be made, that Å¿uch may have convenient place in the church, leaÅ¿t elÅ¿e it occaÅ¿ion in them, either a wandringe from the ParriÅ¿h, or a Neglect to reÅ¿orte to any Church at all. It hath in all ages bene Å¿eene, that Change of condition of things, hath cauÅ¿ed change of former orderinge of thinges; for it is no diÅ¿order to change the antie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t diÅ¿poÅ¿ure of things, vvhen to reteyne the Å¿ame brings with it great diÅ¿order and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150735:15"/>detriment. Moreover, though Changes carry with them diffently of perfourmance, yet experience hath declared, that when the MagiÅ¿trates authority concurreth with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, all difficultyes have readily bene overcome, by the peoples voluntary tendinge their owne Benefit, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of other. Populous Congregations are Å¿urely moÅ¿t meete, both becauÅ¿e a convenient Meanes may be better be raiÅ¿ed for a Teacher or PaÅ¿tor, and a Deacon his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant; and alÅ¿o a plurality of grave and godly Men may be choÅ¿en by turnes, to Å¿erve in that ParriÅ¿h for Governours, accordinge to that which I have written aboue; if therefore Å¿uch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude be appointed, as which beinge cloÅ¿e Å¿eated together, &amp; diÅ¿poÅ¿ed in galleries, the voyce of a Preacher may well be hearde of them, then judge I the Congregation to be duly proportioned. And indeede want of diÅ¿poÅ¿inge the roome of the church, as beÅ¿t may fit to conteyne a greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and this alÅ¿o within hearinge the voice of a Teacher, cauÅ¿eth that farr fewer aÅ¿Å¿emble convenlently then vvere meete; for it is but vaine there to reÅ¿orte, where though the church have roome enough, yet uÅ¿e cannot be made of it for hearinge the Preacher. True it is that Mens voices are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e, neither cann all volces anÅ¿were to the Å¿erled diÅ¿poÅ¿ure; but yet if reÅ¿pect be had to the ordinary voice of Man, and the Roome fitted accordinge thereto, fitter it is that the defect of voice be Å¿upplied by Å¿ome helpe, then that the diÅ¿poÅ¿ure of place for audience be changed. Such PaÅ¿tors therefore as have lowe voices, may doe well to Å¿upply that defect with oftner Preachinge, that Å¿o at one time Å¿ome, at another time others of the ParriÅ¿h may conveniently heare them. TheiÅ¿e things I write of our ParriÅ¿hes in populous Cityes, vvhere the neereneÅ¿s of dwellinge, and multitude of Å¿trangers lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, cauÅ¿eth a very great Congregation in a Å¿male quantity of grounde; but in the Country, where in a very large circuite
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150735:16"/>of grounde are but few inhabitants, the proffit of the people rather then State of a Congregation is to be tendered, leaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by too long leangth and difficulty of way, people be diÅ¿hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from reÅ¿ortinge to Church. Surely the former diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of theiÅ¿e things in this Lande was very good, accordinge to the times, and we in theiÅ¿e tymes neede the leÅ¿s alteration, Å¿ave where the ParriÅ¿h is too Å¿male to yeild a convenient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewe, or elÅ¿e too great to aÅ¿Å¿emble within hearinge of a Preacher. Thus havinge written of our ParriÅ¿h-boundes, I pray that I may write alÅ¿o of the bouudes of our BiÅ¿hopp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and Arch biÅ¿hoppricks.</p>
                     <p>If Arch-BiÅ¿hhopps Å¿ucceede in the Office of Timothy &amp; Titus, meete it is that they execute in the Church that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; therefore the bounds of their Charge Å¿hould be Å¿uch, as wherein conveniently that weighty Charge may be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. And indeede it is fitter to reÅ¿pect rather, the Proffit of the due execution of the Charge, then the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality of the BiÅ¿hop; though both are to be tendered, yet the former rather then the latter.</p>
                     <p>Now, that Arch-BiÅ¿hopps propperly, rather then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hops, Å¿ucceede in the Office of Timothy and Titus, I gather from this evidence: FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e Titus had intruÅ¿ted unto him by the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>the Charge and Care of diverÅ¿e Cityes and their Churches,</hi> Titus, 1.5: Secondly, becauÅ¿e the Scripture Å¿hews by many perticulers, that the Office of Titus, and the Office of Timothy was one and the Å¿ame; but the Office beinge the Å¿ame, the extention of the Charge over diverÅ¿e Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes may alÅ¿o be the Å¿ame: Thirdly, becauÅ¿e the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with one voice, did ever accoumpt of the Offices of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus to be a like: LaÅ¿tly, becauÅ¿e the antient ChriÅ¿tian Church, allowed of the Charge of one over di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e Cityes and their Churches and Officers, as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ApoÅ¿tolically delivered to the church: and in antient
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150735:16"/>tyme Å¿uch were called Arch-BiÅ¿hopps; which alÅ¿o was a Name very antiently given even to the BiÅ¿hop of Rome himÅ¿elfe. TheiÅ¿e thiugs conÅ¿idered I conclude, that in aÅ¿much as now, and in the moÅ¿t antient tymes, Arch-BiÅ¿hops have and had the Charge of the Churches in diverÅ¿e Cityes, therefore they propperly Å¿ucceede in the Office of Timothy and Titus: For Å¿urely City-BiÅ¿hops never had the Charge of diverÅ¿e ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, but onely of one city, and Å¿ome circuit of ground there, about at moÅ¿t. This therefore I now petition your Å¿acred MaieÅ¿tie for, that in Englande, the Office or Charge of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus, be required of our Arch-BiÅ¿hops to be executed by them in this Church: and that the bounds of their IuriÅ¿diction be Å¿o limited, that conveniently they may execute that Charge. And for the Charge, I rather have an eye to that which I fynde in the EpiÅ¿tles of Timothy and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, then to the Canons of the Church in after tyme: for the firÅ¿t I am Å¿ure are neceÅ¿Å¿arye dutyes, for which the Officer is anÅ¿wereable to God; whereas the latter are not of like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Å¿ave onely that they may be wholeÅ¿ome Ordinances, Å¿o farr fourth as they are accordant to the evidence of Å¿acred Scripture. The charge which we fynde given to Timothy and Titus, is a Charge to Å¿ee all of all Å¿orts to live accordinge to the GhoÅ¿pell, and obÅ¿erve the Ordinances of God given to the Church by the ApoÅ¿tles; therefore his Charge Å¿treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to private ChriÅ¿tians, to Å¿ee that they live as the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell requires, and alÅ¿o to all Officers of the Church, to Å¿ee that they be choÅ¿en Å¿uch as are appointed, &amp; perfourme their Offices righty in the Church. Which great Charge that it may the better be effected, the ApoÅ¿tle intruÅ¿ted him with Power, <hi>to commande things that are right, and to receave Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations againÅ¿t them that doe evell, and to Å¿ilence Teachers of evell things, and reiect heretiques,</hi> 1.

In the EpiÅ¿tle to Titus: <hi>That be redreÅ¿s things,</hi> Chap. 1, 5: <hi>That he ordeyne Elders,</hi> chap. 1, 3: <hi>That he Å¿ilence Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of evell thinges,</hi> chap, 1, 10: <hi>That obedience be yeilded to Principalities and Powers,</hi> chap. 3, 1: <hi>That fooliÅ¿h queÅ¿tions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and brawlinges be Å¿taied,</hi> chap. 3, 4: <hi>That Hereticks be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</hi> chap. 3, 10. Many other are the perticulers of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers Charge, as to Å¿ee <hi>that Servants behave themÅ¿elvs as they ought towards their MaÅ¿ters,</hi> Titus, 2, 9: <hi>That Elder Men and Women be Å¿o and Å¿o, and the yonger Men and Women likewiÅ¿e:</hi> and other like; beÅ¿ides <hi>his owne private MiniÅ¿tration of the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi> Now therefore, if the perticulers whereto this Officers Office Å¿treatcheth, be duly conÅ¿idered, let any judge, if our Arch-BiÅ¿hopps bounds in England be convenient for the due executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. For to what end hath a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> charge of theiÅ¿e per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers, if both he be not conveniently neere to viÅ¿it places,

If one Arch-BiÅ¿hop Å¿hould be Å¿et over all England, were it Å¿ufficient? coulde he conveniently exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Charge in the church? neither truly cann two; therefore Arch-BiÅ¿hops Å¿hould be multiplied, that Å¿o the Lande may have Å¿o many, as well may Å¿erve for the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this high Charge.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that Crete is an yle of greate circuit of grounde, and conteyned in old tyme many moe cityes then in theiÅ¿e tymes it doth; but reÅ¿pect is tobe had unto the tymes; for difference is to be put betweene tymes, when but few in a Lande are converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian faith, and when all the people of a Lande are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When few are converted, the Congregations or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are the fewer, and conÅ¿equently the Charge is the leÅ¿s, and the better to be executed, but when all are converted, then, as neceÅ¿Å¿arily the Churches are multiplied Å¿o alÅ¿o is tho Charge increaÅ¿ed, and conÅ¿equently the dutyes of the Office are made the more diÅ¿ticult to be executed in all.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it probable, nor is it likely, that in the time of Titus, all the people in that yle of Crete vvere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the faith; but if they vvere not, then to retayne in the SucceÅ¿Å¿ors hands the Å¿ame extent of grounde as had Titus, were to commit to the leÅ¿s able SucceÅ¿Å¿or, a greater charge of Churches then the ApoÅ¿tle intruÅ¿ted to Titus: vvhich thinge cannot be done, without great preiudice to the ChriÅ¿tian church.</p>
                     <p>As PariÅ¿hes therefore are to be multiplled, and one to be made tvvo or three, after the people growe too many for one Congregation, Å¿o antient Arch-BiÅ¿hoppdomes boundes Å¿houlde be leÅ¿sned, and

DoubtleÅ¿s if our Arch-BiÅ¿hops tooke care as they ought of the perticulers of this Charge, they woulde Å¿oone make a holy People in this Lande, by reaÅ¿on of their neere eye to obÅ¿erve the Å¿everall Churches, and their recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinge AccuÅ¿ations when neede requireth. And truly the Arch-BiÅ¿hops Courte Å¿hould not be ordeyned Å¿o much, for Å¿ome perticulers tendinge to the Rule over other BiÅ¿hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, as it Å¿hould be for the correctinge of diÅ¿obediences in all theiÅ¿e perticulers, when neither in the PariÅ¿hionall, nor in the EpiÅ¿copall Courte and Goverment order is taken in the Å¿ame: For the ArchiepiÅ¿copall Charge is no leÅ¿s, to Å¿ee Evangelicall Ordinances obÅ¿erved in the Manners of every particuler ChriÅ¿tian, then to Å¿ee that PaÅ¿tors and BiÅ¿hops, &amp; other eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Officers, execute their MiniÅ¿trations rightly.</p>
                     <p>I grant, that PariÅ¿hionall, and over them EpiÅ¿copall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verments, greatly eaÅ¿e the Arch-BiÅ¿hop, and becauÅ¿e of them his Charge may be very large, compriÅ¿inge diverÅ¿e BiÅ¿hopdomes; but yet with this caution, that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently viÅ¿it every parte, and alÅ¿o from all parts AccuÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations may conveniently be made unto him; when there is any faile in the PariÅ¿hional and EpiÅ¿copall Goverment. Neither truly ought Arch-BiÅ¿hopdoms to be extended out as Kingedomes: For Kingedomes are in larged or reÅ¿trey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as their Power cann extend its Å¿elfe, which alÅ¿o is ordered by God himÅ¿elf, he letting looÅ¿e and reÅ¿treyninge the Powers as he will; whereas Arch BiÅ¿hopdoms ought to be fitted to the execution of the Charge of the Office. Thus have I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150735:19"/>(Dread Soveraigne) bene the longer in my wrytinge of Arch-BiÅ¿hopps, becauÅ¿e of the neceÅ¿Å¿ary conÅ¿equence, that if they be made leÅ¿s, then BiÅ¿hopdomes alÅ¿o Å¿hould not bee too large, becauÅ¿e diverÅ¿e of them are to be compriÅ¿ed in one Arch BiÅ¿ho-dome. For BiÅ¿hopdomes therefore I in breife pray, that in our England they may be more, that Å¿o they not compriÅ¿inge over many PatiÅ¿hes, the BiÅ¿hop may conveniently viÅ¿it the perticuler PariÅ¿hes, and AccuÅ¿ations conveniently be made out of all PariÅ¿hes which faile in Goverment, unto him. The BiÅ¿hop differeth from the Arch-BiÅ¿hop cheiÅ¿ely in this, that his Charge Å¿treatcheth not over other City BiÅ¿hops, but onely over BiÅ¿hops or PaÅ¿tors and other Cleargy of perticuler Congregations. As for other differences which the Canons of the Church have put, they are neceÅ¿Å¿ary as the tymes require onely: For the Churches Ordinances have ever bene diÅ¿penced with, in caÅ¿es of NeceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity when they could not be obÅ¿erved, and when there is no more needefull uÅ¿e of the Å¿ame; but this difference which here I put, Å¿eemes to be a Divine Ordinance, in aÅ¿much as Titus was Å¿et over diverÅ¿e Cityes and the churches therein, &amp; conÅ¿equently over all eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Officers vvhich neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily are in them. But then if the Arch-BiÅ¿hopps Charge Å¿treacheth to Man and Wife, Parents and Children, MaÅ¿ters and Servants, Å¿einge to it that they in their Manners one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde another, obÅ¿erve the commandements of the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Å¿hould not the BiÅ¿hops Office within his perticuler li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Å¿treatch to the Å¿ame? Therefore I humbly pray, that our BiÅ¿hops Office be not Å¿treigtned unto Å¿ome few perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers, but that it be enlarged to Å¿ee even to all theiÅ¿e things alÅ¿o, as the moÅ¿t weighty perticulers of his Charge. Which thinge duly conÅ¿idered, I hope it will Å¿oone appeare, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arily (for the due Å¿einge unto theiÅ¿e things, and for the convenient makinge of AccuÅ¿ations of breach of them,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150735:20"/>vvhere the PariÅ¿hionall Goverment is remiÅ¿s, not takinge due Care of, and order in Å¿uch things) our BiÅ¿hops juriÅ¿dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be made leÅ¿s, then at this time they are in this our Church of Englande. DoubtleÅ¿s theiÅ¿e Powers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall were cheifely ordeyned, for Rulinge of the Manners of ChriÅ¿tian people, leaÅ¿t they not obÅ¿ervinge one towards another the Evangelicall Commandements, bringe a Å¿candall upon the GhoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿te; therfore into theiÅ¿e thinges Å¿hould our BiÅ¿hops watchfully looke, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themÅ¿elves with the obÅ¿ervation of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons onely. If any Å¿ay, that the deÅ¿cription of this Office is in Scripture Å¿uch, as is rather to be wiÅ¿hed then effected, I anÅ¿were, that the ApoÅ¿tle would not Å¿o deepely Charge Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy with theiÅ¿e perticulers as he doth, 1. Tim, 5, 21, if he thought the execution of theiÅ¿e things to be rather to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed then effected; therefore I hope none Å¿hall be Å¿uffered to Å¿hrowde their Negligence, under the mantle or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of this deviÅ¿e. If in after tymes many inventions are made, to buÅ¿y Atch-BiÅ¿hopps &amp; BiÅ¿hopps Å¿o with them, that they cannot attend to theiÅ¿e other, are theiÅ¿e which are the weightleÅ¿t to be left for the lighter? Shall honor and Glory attend rather thoÅ¿e then theiÅ¿e? were not this a notable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a Å¿nare of Satan, and an inÅ¿ufferable divertion from the true EpiÅ¿copall dutyes?

                     <p>THe permiÅ¿Å¿ion of inconvenient extents of IuriÅ¿diction, hath bene the cheife cauÅ¿e, not onely of the diÅ¿orders of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Politie, and of the evell execution of true EpiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Charges, but alÅ¿o of the AntichriÅ¿ts Reigninge in the Church; therefore high tyme it is that in the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, this maine error be taken order for. It is reported of that firÅ¿t great &amp; famous Councill of Nice, that it confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the BiÅ¿hops of certaine cityes, the huge extents which formerly their Charge had Å¿treatched its Å¿elfe unto; but what followed hereupon? Å¿urely there followed not onely the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency of Å¿uch great Powers, and the inÅ¿atiable affectation of Glory, but alÅ¿o the openinge or reveilinge of that Man of Å¿inne. For as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aid, 2. TheÅ¿Å¿al. 2, 6: <hi>And now ye knowe what withholdeth, that he might be reveiled in his tyme,</hi> Å¿o indeede it fell out; for the Emperors keepinge his Seate at Rome, withheld the BiÅ¿hopp of Romes Reveilinge; but the Emperor removinge his Seate to ConÅ¿tantinople, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Nice Å¿ome few yeares after was aÅ¿Å¿embled, where theiÅ¿e huge extents of IuriÅ¿diction beinge confirmed, the BiÅ¿hop of Rome beinge held as Cheife of them, this cauÅ¿ed his firÅ¿t meaÅ¿ure of Reveilinge. It is fit therefore that that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils proceedings be examined, whither in oughts God left it to diÅ¿Å¿ent from his Å¿acred Worde. PapiÅ¿ts uÅ¿ually alleadge that Councill, as countenancinge the offeringe up of the Body and Blood of the Lord in the Service of the Lords Supper; but if this that Councill did, then expreÅ¿sly erred it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150735:21"/>from the Scriptureis nÅ¿truction concerninge that Service. And how neere it was to forbid PreiÅ¿ts, the copulation with their vvives vvhich Gods worde commandes, 1. Cor, 7, 3, is well knowen to all that have read the Story of thoÅ¿e tymes. To this I may add, the uncertainety of its Canons, Å¿einge they are with Å¿uch uncertainety brought us by Tradition. For all theiÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons I conclude, that that Councill is not Å¿o to be maintayned in its Ordinances, as that the inÅ¿truction of Å¿acred Scripture is not rather to be followed. But who that looketh into the holy Scripture Å¿hall not Å¿ee, That Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus &amp; Å¿uch as were like them, held the higheÅ¿t ordinary Offices in the Church next unto the ApoÅ¿tles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elvs? for by the EpiÅ¿tles of Timothy and Titus it is evident, that the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿et them in Office next himÅ¿elfe over the Churches that were planted. Churches were planted, and they had their Officers and Governours, but then the ApoÅ¿tle ordeyned theiÅ¿e over them againe, and this is manifeÅ¿t in that Titus had Charge over diverÅ¿e Cityes. WhilÅ¿t there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is this evidence for their Office: and whilÅ¿t there is that evidence before noted, that our Arch-BiÅ¿hops Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede them in that Office: and vvhilÅ¿t the Church ever held a ceÅ¿Å¿ation of ApoÅ¿tles, and the ApoÅ¿tle, 1. Cor. 4, 9, Å¿aith: <hi>I thinke that God hath Å¿et fourth us the laÅ¿t ApoÅ¿tles, &amp;c:</hi> We have good reaÅ¿on, not to Å¿uffer other offices to uÅ¿urpe Authority over Arch-BiÅ¿hops; or any Arch-BiÅ¿hopps to be Å¿ubiugated unto any other EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall MiniÅ¿tration. But if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the continuance of thoÅ¿e huge extents whereof we read, then, as neceÅ¿Å¿arily many Arch-BiÅ¿hopdomes, yea Patriarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes muÅ¿t be compriÅ¿ed therein, Å¿o the BiÅ¿hop of that Seate muÅ¿t be advanced over, and exerciÅ¿e a MiniÅ¿tration ovet Arch-BiÅ¿hopps, yea over Patriarchs; which thinge what is it, but both an evertion of the Politie eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall, which God by his Ordinance (ApoÅ¿tles taken away) Å¿ent the church
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150735:21"/>withall under the Wings of Kinges and Princes: and alÅ¿o a bringinge in Superiorityes, Throanes, and Powers, never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned by the Lord? As therefore experience hath Å¿howen, that when an Arch-BiÅ¿hoprick hath neceÅ¿Å¿arily bene divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then tvvo Arch-BiÅ¿hops are placed therein, without Å¿ubiugating the one under the other, Å¿o thoÅ¿e antient extents of bounds, ought with the increaÅ¿e of the Convertion of people, to have bene divided into many Arch-BiÅ¿hopdomes, and this without Å¿ubiugatinge every of them to the Arch-BiÅ¿hopp of Å¿ome one city, who by this meanes, as he is to take a New Title, Å¿o alÅ¿o he entereth into a new MiniÅ¿tration never ordeyned by the Lord.</p>
                     <p>If any Å¿ay, hath not every SncceÅ¿Å¿or right, to retayne the bownds of his predeceÅ¿Å¿ors juriÅ¿diction? I anÅ¿were, yes, where there is no prejudice thereby to the Church, and to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God; but when retayninge the Å¿ame, he muÅ¿t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arily Rule over them, whom God by his Ordinance Å¿et next unto ApoÅ¿tles, he then Å¿ubverts the Ordinance of God, Å¿o longe as he cannot make himÅ¿elfe an ApoÅ¿tle. Neither cann any ones Å¿ucceedinge in the Seate of an ApoÅ¿tle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr upon him an ApoÅ¿tles Dignity and Office: for this were to make Å¿uch a one an ApoÅ¿tle; but we have good cauÅ¿e to aÅ¿ke of Å¿uch a one the Å¿ignes of his ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hip, 2. Cor. 12, 12. I conclude therefore, that thoÅ¿e extents of IuriÅ¿dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which carry with them a bringinge into the Church, Powers and MiniÅ¿trations above that of Arch-BiÅ¿hops, are unlawfull, as bringinge into the Church Å¿trange MiniÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have no manner warrant from Gods Worde in Scripture, but rather are contrary to the Politie which there God manifeÅ¿teth to his Church. And indeede becauÅ¿e of the huge extent of the Pope of Romes juriÅ¿diction, we fynde that above Arch BiÅ¿hopps are Patriarchs, as alÅ¿o Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls (as now Cardinalls are) &amp; Popes Legats, and a rabble
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150735:22"/>of other, who all Å¿erve rather as MiniÅ¿ters of this Corruption of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical Politie warranted by God, then of the church, &amp; of the GhoÅ¿pell. For how many are the Officers which the Pope of Rome needeth for to Å¿erve him only, in the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of Å¿o large a juriÅ¿dictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as now he exerciÅ¿eth? even Å¿o propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably is it with every Patriarch, yea with every Arch-BiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hop when he hath a IuriÅ¿diction Å¿o farr extended fourth, as that neither he can perÅ¿onally viÅ¿it conveniently the parts of his Charge, nor they of his Charge cann conveniently make AccuÅ¿atio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s unto him, if the PariÅ¿hional or EpiÅ¿copal Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments faile in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of IuÅ¿tice. But now, Å¿einge God hath given Å¿o bleÅ¿Å¿ed TeÅ¿timony, to the Reforminge of things by his worde in Scripture, why Å¿hould not Å¿uch Offices be cut off, as Å¿uperfluous and juÅ¿tly OffenÅ¿ive, which exerciÅ¿e any Authority over the Arch-BiÅ¿hops of the ChriÅ¿tian church? Should we not thinke that the Lord expects a Reformation even herein, aÅ¿well as in Doctryne? Should not his vvords direction be of power with us, aÅ¿well in Reforminge errors of IuriÅ¿dictions, or Powers &amp; Offices, as in reforminge of Doctrynes? Therefore if the Scripture Å¿hew, that the Offices of Timothy &amp; Titus, was the higheÅ¿t ordinary Office in the Church, after ApoÅ¿tles ceaÅ¿ed, as beinge in the life tyme of the ApoÅ¿tles next to the ApoÅ¿tles: and if there be good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that thoÅ¿e had under them at the moÅ¿t but BiÅ¿hopps of Cityes, then why Å¿hould not Arch-BiÅ¿hopps be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as Succeeders into their Office, and conÅ¿equently to be the higheÅ¿t eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Officer, which God Å¿ent the Church with amonge the Nations, after his taking away of ApoÅ¿tles? If it be Å¿aid, that thoÅ¿e who Å¿ucceeded into the Seates of Timothy or Titus, and others like them, are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, not Arch-BiÅ¿hopps, then I demande, what Manner BiÅ¿hops cann any prove that either Timothy or Titus, or the next SucceÅ¿Å¿ors ruled over? whither were they Arch-BiÅ¿hos
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150735:22"/>or onely BiÅ¿hopps of Cityes? Surely, the greateÅ¿t evidence of pureÅ¿t and moÅ¿t antient Tradition is, that thoÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e Seates were firÅ¿t accoumpted but Arch-BiÅ¿hops, and though they Å¿eemed to have Charge of a greate circuit of grownde, yet where any Arch-BiÅ¿hop was ordeyned, I fynde not any good evidence, that they exerciÅ¿ed Authority over them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o, as now Patriarchs doe over them, and the Pope over Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches. As for the extendinge out of Care, or Å¿eeminge-Charge of the Churches in greate extent, we fynde in antient tyme, not onely an affectation, but alÅ¿o a reall effectinge, of chalenginge the Charge of all thoÅ¿e Churches, whereunto Å¿ome BiÅ¿hop of Å¿peciall Accoumpt Å¿treatched his AdviÅ¿e &amp; CounÅ¿alle: as if over all, to whom AdviÅ¿e and CounÅ¿aile is given, the giver of AdviÅ¿e &amp; CounÅ¿alle Å¿hould have Charge, &amp; over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> exerciÅ¿e EpiÅ¿copall Authority. If thus the BiÅ¿hops of thoÅ¿e tymes did, (and Å¿ome evidence there is that Å¿ome Å¿o did) then this is no Å¿ufficient warrant, for chalenginge of Å¿o exceÅ¿Å¿ive charges or IuriÅ¿dictions as Å¿ome Patriarchs &amp; Arch-BiÅ¿hops chalenge; much leÅ¿s Å¿hould we admit of Å¿uch exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when we Å¿ee that it is diÅ¿cordant to the Ordinance of God, as I have before Å¿hewed. Moreover, if the Councill of Nice approved of Å¿uch large &amp; exceÅ¿Å¿ive extents of Care and IuriÅ¿diction in any, yet we are to thinke, that it but Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that IuriÅ¿diction which they then had; but at that tyme the extentions of InriÅ¿diction were not Å¿o large as in after tyme. Had the Pope of Rome then Å¿uch IuriÅ¿diction as now, when no parte of Germany, nor other Nations had embraced the faith as Å¿ince they did? Or Å¿hould we thinke that that Councill Å¿ubiugated to that BiÅ¿hop, Churches not as then propagated? If no, then neither by warrant of holy Scripture, nor by warrant of that Councill, hath that BiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hop any right of IuriÅ¿diction over all the Arch-BiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hopps of all the ChriÅ¿tian Nations in the WeÅ¿t:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150735:23"/>As for claime as SucceÅ¿Å¿or to the ApoÅ¿tle Peter, it is Å¿trange that he alone, Å¿hould make a claime of Å¿ucceedinge to an ApoÅ¿tle; for where be the other BiÅ¿hops, who claime to Å¿ucceede to this or that ApoÅ¿tle? I fynde none but him of Antioch: and that alÅ¿o rather a figment of the BiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hop of Romes, then any true claime of that BiÅ¿hops. And as for his claime from Scripture, I have elÅ¿ew here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be directly againÅ¿t that which our Lord commanded to his ApoÅ¿tles.</p>
                     <p>TheiÅ¿e things conÅ¿idered, I now humbly beÅ¿eech yourÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred MajeÅ¿tie, that as hitherto you have Å¿howen great favour to our Cleargy, Å¿o you will continue to preÅ¿erve them from any forreine and unlawfull eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Powers, which would chalenge Authority over them. Princes may doe well to have an eye at the vviÅ¿edome, and gratious Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, obÅ¿ervinge with what Powers eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall he (ApoÅ¿tles taken away) Å¿ent the Church under their wings: For Å¿urely there cann be no better Politie of eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Goverment for Princes, then that which we fynde the Lord to leave in the Church, after his takinge away of ApoÅ¿tles. Should the Lord Å¿end any Officet under the wings of Princes, who Å¿hould Å¿treatch his Authority farr further, then any Prince cann Å¿treatch his vvings of protection? Or Å¿hould one BiÅ¿hopp be under the vvings of many Princes protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? vvhat then if thoÅ¿e Princes fall at variance, Å¿hall the one protect his AdverÅ¿aries Å¿ubiecte?</p>
                     <p>Therefore I cannot but conclude, that as it is not good for the Church, Å¿o it is alÅ¿o in convenient &amp; dangerous for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that there be in the church any EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical MiniÅ¿ters of huge extents of IuriÅ¿diction, Å¿uch as are Å¿ome Patriarchs, and the Pope of Rome.</p>

                     <hi>OF King Hezekias we reade, 2, Chron, 31, 4: That he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people that dwelt in HieruÅ¿alem, to give a part to the PreiÅ¿ts and Levits, that they might be in couraged in the Lawe of the Lord And when the Commandement was Å¿pread, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of IÅ¿raell brought abondaunce of firÅ¿t fruicts, of Corne, and Wine, and Oile, and Hony, and of all the increaÅ¿e of the Feild, and the Tithes of all things brought they aboundantly. And Hezekias queÅ¿tioned the PreiÅ¿ts and the Levits, concerning the Heapes. And Azariah the cheife PreiÅ¿t, of the houÅ¿e of Zadock, anÅ¿wered him, and Å¿aid, Å¿ince the people begann to bringe the Offerings into the houÅ¿e of the Lord, we have eaten, and have bene Å¿atisfied, and there is left in aboundannce. And Hezekias commaunded to prepare Chambers in the houÅ¿e of the Lord, and they prepared them, and caried in the firÅ¿t fruicts, and the tythes, and the dedicate thinges faithfully. And over them was Coniah the Levite the cheife, and Shimei his brother the Å¿econd. And Core the Sonne of Imnah the Levite Porter toward the eaÅ¿t, was over the things that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingely offered unto God, to diÅ¿tribute to their Brethren the Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, and the holy things that were conÅ¿ecrate, their daily portions. Againe, of Kinge IoÅ¿ias we reade, 2. Chron, 34, 8: That he Å¿ent Shafan and MaaÅ¿eiah the Governour of the City, and Ioah the Recorder, to repaire the houÅ¿e of the Lord. And when they came to Hilkia the high PreiÅ¿t, they delivered the money that was brought into the houÅ¿e of God, which the Levits that kept the dore had gathered, at the hands of ManaÅ¿Å¿ch and Ephraim, and of all the reÅ¿idue of IÅ¿rael, and of all Iudas and Beniamin, and of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150735:24"/>inhabitants of HieruÅ¿alem. And they put it into the hands of them which Å¿hould doe the worke. Againe, Exodus, 36; 3, we reade thus: And they received of MoÅ¿es all the Offeringes, which the Children of IÅ¿rael had brought, for the worke of the Å¿ervice of the Sanctuary to make it: AlÅ¿o they brought Å¿till unto him free Gifts every morninge. So all the wiÅ¿e men that wrought all the holy worke, came every Man from his worke which they had wrought, and Å¿pake to MoÅ¿es, Å¿aying: The people bringe too much, and more then enough for the uÅ¿e of the worke, which the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be made. Then MoÅ¿es gave a Commandement, and they cauÅ¿ed it to be proclaimed throughout the hoÅ¿te, Å¿aying: Let neither Man nor Woman, prepare any more worke for the Oblation of the Sanctuary. So the people were staied from Offeringe.</hi>

                  <p>In theiÅ¿e Scriptures I note theiÅ¿e fower things Å¿pecially: FirÅ¿t, That the Kinge commanded the People, to give to the Maintenance of the MiniÅ¿ters: Secondly, That Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is for their incouragement to Å¿erve in the MiniÅ¿tery: Thirdly, That the Kinge cared alÅ¿o for the Repairinge of the Churches, wherein God was vvorÅ¿ hipped: LaÅ¿tly, That when there was a Sufficiency, this was to be acknowledged by the Cleargy, and the People were to be Å¿taied from giving; According to which obÅ¿ervations, I humbly pray, that I may petition your Å¿acred MajeÅ¿tie, as hereunder Å¿hall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                  <p>It beinge the Commandement and Ordinance of God, 1. Cor. 9, 14, that the MiniÅ¿ters of the GhoÅ¿pell be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned by them to whom they MiniÅ¿ter the GhoÅ¿pell, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians are bounde to fynde them Maintenance, if they be not bounde alÅ¿o to maintayne them by Tythes, firÅ¿t fruicts, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will Offeringes, and the like. But where the Manner of doinge is not appointed by God, vvhen yet the thinge to be done is appointed, there Gods MiniÅ¿ters of Rule and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150735:24"/>have Power to appointe the Manner of doinge, and none may lawfully except againÅ¿t the Manner which they appointe. In this church of England then, your MajeÅ¿tics famous PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors havinge ordeyned, and your Å¿elfe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouÅ¿ly confirmed, that the MiniÅ¿ters Maintenance be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Tythinge of your people, I moÅ¿t humbly pray, that the full Tythes of the Lande be given to the Lords Cleargy. DoubtleÅ¿s (dread Soveraigne) the permiÅ¿Å¿ion of Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where, not the Cleargy, but Lay perÅ¿ons reape the Tythes, cauÅ¿eth both a diÅ¿couragement to Gods Cleargy, through want of convenient Maintenance in Å¿uch PariÅ¿hes: and alÅ¿o a Å¿cantery of able MiniÅ¿ters to Å¿erve the Lord in thoÅ¿e places. And truly it is lamentable to obÅ¿erve, both how poorely Å¿ome Cleargy are faine to live, even there where they execute the Office of their MiniÅ¿try, and where a Lay Man gathers Å¿uch a quantery of Tythes, as would Å¿erve for a Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Maintenance for one or two of the Cleargy: and alÅ¿o how many MiniÅ¿ters, painefull in Preachinge the GhoÅ¿pell, after they have vvorne out their life in poverty, leave their vvife and children (well neere) to beggery. But Å¿einge it is Gods Lawe that his Cleargy may marry, 1. Tim. 1, 2: and Å¿einge it is likewiÅ¿e his Lawe, that the married yeild due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, 1. Cor. 7, 3, meete it is, that the Cleargyes portions be Å¿uch, as that they may (with thrift) lay up alÅ¿o for their Wife and children. Yea, the ApoÅ¿tle in Å¿ayinge, 2. Cor. 12, 14: <hi>for the Children ought not to lay up for the fathers, but the fathers for the Children,</hi> implies a NeceÅ¿Å¿ity laid upon all fathers, and amonge them Å¿uch of the Cleargy as have children, that they provide and lay up for their children; therefore Å¿uch Cleargy as keepe Å¿uch HoÅ¿pitality, as Å¿pendes the Revenewe of their livings, are rather to be blamed then commended, whilÅ¿t withall they lay not up for their vvife and children. Moreover, Å¿einge it were moÅ¿t unbefittinge ChriÅ¿tians, to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150735:25"/>villify the MiniÅ¿ters of the GhoÅ¿pell in maintenance, whom they are to have in honor for the MiniÅ¿tration of the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, moÅ¿t meete it is, that every PariÅ¿ hes allowance, every BiÅ¿hopdomes, and Arch-BiÅ¿hopdomes allowance be Å¿uch, as may Å¿erve for to maintayne each of the Cleargy, in Å¿uch ranck and faÅ¿hion as beÅ¿t beÅ¿eemeth; therefore as our BiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hops and Arch-BiÅ¿hops have place of eminency and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity amonge our Nobles, Å¿o the PaÅ¿tors of Congregations are to have Å¿uch Maintenance as may in able them to beare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, rather with the better then with the meaner Å¿orte in each ParriÅ¿h. As for our BiÅ¿hops and Arch-BiÅ¿hops, their Maintenance is already commendably greate, through the large Bounty of our fore-fathers, and your MajeÅ¿ties confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what they now injoy thereof; but becauÅ¿e I have in the former Chapter intreated, for the multiplyinge of the number of Arch-BiÅ¿hops and BiÅ¿hops in this Church, I now humbly petition your MajeÅ¿tie, that I may move unto one thinge which would be needefull. If it be neceÅ¿Å¿ary that there be more BiÅ¿hopricks and Arch-BiÅ¿hopricks in Englande, then now there are, (and this I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) then it followes neceÅ¿Å¿arily that Maintenance alÅ¿o be increaÅ¿ed. I therefore petition, That unto that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready our BiÅ¿hops have among them, there may be added a taxe upon all the People of the Lande, that every houÅ¿e-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der contribute a Å¿male yearely Gift to his BiÅ¿hop, and an other Å¿male Guift to the Arch-BiÅ¿hop in whoÅ¿e Province he is; for by the multitude of families in a BiÅ¿hopdome, a Å¿male matter raiÅ¿ed from every family, would affoorde a very greate portion to the BiÅ¿hop: and by the multitude of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in an Arch-BiÅ¿hopprick, the like greate portion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably would ariÅ¿e to the Arch-BiÅ¿hop. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the BiÅ¿hop and the Arch-BiÅ¿hop woulde be the more bounde, to have care of, and (vvithout Charge) often to viÅ¿it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150735:25"/>privately, the Å¿everall PariÅ¿hes, Å¿einge to it that all things be therein accordinge as they ought to be: for it cannot vvell be that they Å¿hould neglect them, when halfe yearely or quarterly they are put in mynde of them by their Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence unto them. And verily, better it is for Gods people, accordinge to their Å¿everall conditions of quallity, to parte vvith an eaÅ¿y payment, of Å¿ix pence, or a Å¿hillinge quarterly, or more or leÅ¿s, to their BiÅ¿hop and Arch-BiÅ¿hop, that here-through their IuriÅ¿dictions being the Å¿maller, they may prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably execute in them their Å¿everall MiniÅ¿trations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to Gods Ordinance, then for want hereof to Å¿uffer them to injoy Å¿o large and Å¿patious IuriÅ¿dictions for Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality and Revenewe, as that they doe not, nor conveniently cann, execute rightly their Å¿everall dutyes and Offices. I grant that every PariÅ¿hes Charge is already greate, by the payinge of Tithes, or other Å¿omes of mony, towards the Maintenance of the Cleargy of their Å¿everall PariÅ¿hes; but yet, for Å¿o good and proffitable an occaÅ¿ion as is this, they Å¿hall doe ChriÅ¿tianly to beare moreover a Å¿male taxe for their BiÅ¿hop, and another for their Arch-BiÅ¿hop.</p>
                  <p>Greate was the bounty of our PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors in this kynde, and this alÅ¿o done even under Popery; and Å¿hall we then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyinge a moÅ¿t happy Reformation, and a pure Doctryne, be greived to parte with a little? In the Å¿econd of Chronicles, chap. 31, 8, we reade thus: <hi>And when Hezekiah and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces came and Å¿awe the heapes, they bleÅ¿sed the Lord, and his people IÅ¿raell.</hi> So likewiÅ¿e, 2. Cor. 9, 12, the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith thus: <hi>The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tration of this Service, not onely Å¿upplieth the neceÅ¿sities of the Saincts, but alÅ¿o is aboundant by the ThankÅ¿givinge of many unto God.</hi> And, Phili pp. 4, 17, he Å¿aith: <hi>Not that I deÅ¿ire a Gift but I deÅ¿ire the fruict which may further your reckoninge. Now I have received all: and have plenty: I was even filled, after that I had received of Epaphroditus that which came from you, an odour that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150735:26"/>Å¿melleth Å¿weete, a Å¿acrifice acceptable and pleaÅ¿ant to God.</hi> Here we Å¿ee what BleÅ¿Å¿ings, what ThankÅ¿givinge to God, this libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in Gods people towards the Lords MiniÅ¿ters, Å¿tirred up in the Kinges and ApoÅ¿tles of the Church, here we Å¿ee alÅ¿o that this is to God as a Sacrifice acceptable, and pleaÅ¿inge unto him. And our Lord himÅ¿elfe, Math. 10, 42, Å¿aith thus: <hi>WhoÅ¿oever Å¿hall give unto one of theiÅ¿e little ones to drinke a Cup of cold Water onely, in the Name of a DiÅ¿ciple, verely I Å¿ay unto you, he Å¿hall not loÅ¿e his rewarde.</hi> It is a pretious thinge therefore in the Å¿ight of God, when any one giveth to his MiniÅ¿ters, becauÅ¿e they are his MiniÅ¿ters, and giveth not onely of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity or of Superfluity; for we muÅ¿t not give, onely becauÅ¿e of our Superfluity we cann give; but we ought to give in faith, Å¿ayinge in our hearts: Lord, this is a MiniÅ¿ter of thy Church, I give therefore to him, Beleevinge thy vvorde of Acceptance. This is a holy Liberality: this true ChriÅ¿tian Liberality, therefore thus mynded, (and not grudgingely, or onely for the Lawes Å¿ake) we Å¿hould give to the Maintenance of the Lords MiniÅ¿ters. For this cauÅ¿e as I have vvritten for our BiÅ¿hopps and Arch-BiÅ¿hopps, Å¿o I write alÅ¿o for our ParriÅ¿h Cleargy, that the full Tythes be allovved, and that Peoples free will Offeringes may be admitted, untill each Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h throughout the Land, have a competent Meanes for the Cleargy of the Å¿ame. How bounrifull were our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ors in givinge of Lands for a certainety of Revenewe, to frieries and Nunneries? if then they were Å¿o bountifull where God impoÅ¿ed no bond Å¿o to doe, and this upon them who proved unproffitable Members of the Church, Å¿hould not we much more give Å¿ome parte of our Lands, for a certainety of maintenance to the needefull Cleargy of our PariÅ¿hes! If therefore any PariÅ¿hes be Å¿o Å¿male, or poore, that it yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not a competent Meanes for the Cleargy thereof, it would be a bleÅ¿Å¿ed thinge, if thoÅ¿e that are able, give Å¿ome
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150735:26"/>parte of their Lande, to yeild to the Å¿ame a certainety of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewe, beÅ¿ides the Tithes, and other Benefits which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h its Å¿elfe yeildeth. The needefull Cleargy of a ParriÅ¿h I accoumpt, a PaÅ¿tor or Teacher, and a Deacon for an aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant unto him; for truly it is not meete, that we put him to read Divine Service alwayes, and alwayes to doe other Cleargi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Dutyes, who Å¿hould give himÅ¿elfe diligently to Reading, that he may Preach the GhoÅ¿pell often unto us, and Å¿oundly. If therefore in PariÅ¿hes already Å¿ufficiently provided for, there be any Å¿o ChriÅ¿tianly mynded, as that of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions they will Å¿et by a parte, towards the Maintenance of the Cleargy of another ParriÅ¿h which hath neede, I humbly petition your MajeÅ¿tie that you gratiouÅ¿ly permit this. To theiÅ¿e I may add the Maintayninge of Å¿uch Officers alÅ¿o, as are neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the perfourmance of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and Divine Service in our Cathedralls: and alÅ¿o Å¿uch as neceÅ¿Å¿arily neede in our Schooles and UniverÅ¿ities; for if God Å¿o gratiouÅ¿ly accepted, 1. Chron. 17, 1, of the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the State and Magnificence of his vvorÅ¿hipp, which vve fynde after the Buildinge of the Temple, then may we under the ChriÅ¿tianity alÅ¿o Beleeve, that our Princes caringe to increaÅ¿e in a tyme of the Churches proÅ¿perity, the State &amp; Magnificence of the vvorÅ¿hipp of God, is moÅ¿t acceptable to God, and conÅ¿equently the Officers neceÅ¿Å¿ary in Å¿uch Service may, (though not all as Cleargy) be maintayned of the Charte of Gods people. And Å¿o likewiÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e the churches Å¿upply with learned &amp; able MiniÅ¿ters is Å¿ight needful, therfore as our Schooles or UniverÅ¿ities are needefull, for the trayning up of Å¿ome hereunto, Å¿o the Governours of them are alÅ¿o needefull, as doinge for Gods Church a very Å¿peciall Service; therefore alÅ¿o Å¿uch are to be Maintayned at the Charge of Gods people, that Å¿o they may be incouraged in the Service of the Lord. But one thing here I wiÅ¿h and petition for, that

                  <p>Thus having written for the Maintenance of our MiniÅ¿ters, I wil proceede to write alÅ¿o of the Repairing of our churches.</p>
                  <p>If the Lord Å¿o gratiouÅ¿ly accepted, of the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of Kinge David, concerninge increaÅ¿inge the MagnificenÅ¿e of the vvorÅ¿hipp of God, 1. Chron. 17, 3, by changinge the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle into a glorious and magnificent Temple, why Å¿hould we not thinke that under the ChriÅ¿tianity alÅ¿o, the Lord moÅ¿t gratiouÅ¿ly regardeth our beautifyinge of the very Temples where he is vvorÅ¿hipped? how ill befitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is it, that in this lands, but Å¿pecially in our country PariÅ¿hes, Gods Temples are moÅ¿t baÅ¿ely provided for, lyinge Å¿o ruined, and Å¿o duÅ¿ty, as that it cannot but abate the devotion of Gods people. My humble petition is therefore unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿tie, that you provinge an engliÅ¿h IoÅ¿iah, zealous of the glory and Å¿plendour of Gods Temples, permit the free will Offeringes of your people, untill there be Å¿ufficient for the Repayringe and Adorninge of the Churches of God. It is truly an error in Å¿ome under the Reformation, that they (Å¿o as they but vvorÅ¿hipp God in his Temple) make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience of Beautifyinge and Enrichinge alÅ¿o the place of AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblinge; but now from the Example of the Church under the Lawe we Å¿ee, how acceptable to God the Care and Bounty of Gods Kinges and People is, even in this matter of Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyinge the very Churches wherein we vvorÅ¿hipp God. As for the manner of Adorninge of Churches, though Å¿ome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150735:28"/>like Pictures of holy Stories, yet I rather wiÅ¿h a pain tinge &amp; guildinge, as the Arches, and faÅ¿hion of pillars, wil beÅ¿t agree with, and a wrytinge of Divine Stories here and there. For truly I fynde the Lord, no where to commend to his people any former things done, to be repreÅ¿ented by Pictures; but rather he commends unto them a writinge of his vvorde about their howÅ¿es, and in memoriall of things paÅ¿Å¿ed, to Å¿et up either Stones, or other like things, which carry no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblance of the thinge done, This I take to be to the end, that for matters of faith, which vve muÅ¿t have faith of that once it vvas done, he vvould not uÅ¿e us to any repreÅ¿enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Å¿ame to our eye. And indeede what this DeviÅ¿e of picturinge Divine Stories in Churches came unto under Popery, vve may mourningely perceave; for the next to this was Images alÅ¿o, and then Idolatry. Men are too proane to delight to be put in mynde of things of faith, by pictures of the Å¿ame Å¿et before their eye; but it is the next way to put faith out of the hearte, and argues a falle in wardly of the Å¿ight of thoÅ¿e things, by faith of the vvorde reade and Preached. For theiÅ¿e cauÅ¿es (Dread Soveraigne) I humbly petion, that your people be not accouÅ¿tomed againe as under Popery, to Pictures of things of the Divine Story; but rather that they may learne to have a Å¿ight, through faith of the vvorde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and reade, &amp; Å¿o adorne the Churches rather with Å¿eeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paintinges and guildinges, then with paintinge of Stories. Moreover, becauÅ¿e in Å¿ome places the Congregation is Å¿o greate, and the Church either Å¿o Å¿cante, or Å¿o ill provided of roome, that the people ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not conveniently kneele at praier, or Å¿it the tyme of the Sermon, meete it is that Å¿uch Churches be either in larged, or provided of Galleries and formes, as neede requireth; for it is no Å¿male diÅ¿order, when a Church is glorious by Adorninges, and yet not fitted for the peoples worÅ¿hipp. LaÅ¿tly, whereas our Church (in the ordinary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150735:29"/>hath well ordered, a Å¿ettinge aparte one parte of the Church for Men, another for Women, Å¿o preventinge a dangerous intermixture of the Sexes in that place, I humbly petition, that the diÅ¿order hereof in Å¿ome populous Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations may be redreÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
                  <p>If therefore at any populous AÅ¿Å¿embly it fall out, that there be diÅ¿order herein, meete it is that the Governours have power of the Seates, to diÅ¿poÅ¿e them to Men, &amp; Women a parte by themÅ¿elvs; neither truly is there in theiÅ¿e tymes little neede of this, if the vvickedneÅ¿s of Å¿ome in populous Congregations were knowen. To avoide therefore an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion and advantage of evell, it is very neeedefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve more Å¿trictly then now uÅ¿ually is done, that cuÅ¿tome of our Church, in orderinge one parte of the Church for Men, the other for Women.</p>
                  <p>Thus havinge written alÅ¿o of the Repayringe and Ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of Churches, I humbly pray, that I may proceede to the laÅ¿t obÅ¿ervation made upon the former collected Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which was, That when there was a Sufficiency, this was to be acknowledged by the Cleargy, and the people to be Å¿taied from Offeringe.</p>
                  <p>It hath bene an old fault in the Cleargy, but Å¿pecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Popery, never to acknowledge a Sufficiency of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but to be ever cryinge, Give, Give, and this to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ufferable burtheninge of Gods people. And which worÅ¿e is, there hath bene a multiplyinge of the Orders of Cleargy, above that which in old tymes was: and alÅ¿o an increaÅ¿e of Offices, rather for the Service of the Romane Papacyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull extent of IuriÅ¿diction, then for the neceÅ¿Å¿ary Service of the GhoÅ¿pell, and of the worÅ¿hipp of God. Neither have wicked Men reÅ¿ted vvith this, but they have added, the Å¿warminge of religious Orders of friers and Nunnes, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge them (all that may be) to exhauÅ¿t ThreaÅ¿ure from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150735:29"/>Gods people. Therefore when a Lande is well divided in to PariÅ¿hes, BiÅ¿hopdomes, and Arch-BiÅ¿hopdomes, and when the Cathedrall Churches, and Schooles, are of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Number, fit it is, that theiÅ¿e havinge Å¿ufficient Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, it may be to the glory of God acknowledged, and all unneceÅ¿Å¿ary burthenings of Gods people removed. And truly it is a wonder to Å¿ee the corruption of things, in that the falÅ¿e Cleargy, and the Offices Å¿ervinge rather the AntichriÅ¿tian uÅ¿urpation, then the MiniÅ¿tration of the GhoÅ¿pell, and the unlawfull orders of Friers and Nunnes, exhauÅ¿t farr more of the ThreaÅ¿ure of Gods people, then doth the true and neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cleargy ordeined by God. As for falÅ¿e Orders of Cleargy, me thinkes the very evidence of their addition, to the Orders of Cleargy in the primitive tymes, Å¿hould move men to perceave and hate the Corruption. And as for thoÅ¿e Offices which Å¿erve the Pope rather then the GhoÅ¿pell, me thinkes that the evidence of the evell of the Popes extent of IuriÅ¿diction, Å¿hould move the Nations to put of from them the burthen of all Å¿uch Offices. And for Prieries and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, Å¿einge the GhoÅ¿pell warrants not, that every one that will but give himÅ¿elfe to Praier, Å¿hould preÅ¿ently charge the Church of God; but rather ordeynes, <hi>that all eate their owne Bread,</hi> 2. TheÅ¿Å¿al. 3, 10, except Gods Cleargy, even they who MiniÅ¿ter the GhoÅ¿pel, 1. Cor. 9, 6; therefore me thinkes, that as the Nations would not be guilty, of maintayninge Å¿uch as live inordinately, and this to the expreÅ¿s diÅ¿obeyinge of a very Å¿peciall Ordinance of God, Å¿o they Å¿hould not Å¿uffer among them the Å¿warminge of Friers and Nunnes, who all live of other, not of their owne labour or Meanes. True it is, that it hath bene an Ornament to the Church, yea and to the GhoÅ¿pell, that Å¿ome Å¿ingle PerÅ¿ons have given up themÅ¿elvs to Å¿erve God extraordinarily in Praiers and Supplications, and to be Å¿erviceable in ChriÅ¿tian Dutyes to Å¿uch as had Neede,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150735:30"/>yea and to live Å¿ingle and chaÅ¿te; but though vve under the Reformation alÅ¿o, may doe well to honor Å¿uch in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, yet let us not bynde them by ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion or vowe ever to continue Å¿o, but rather commend them to Gods Grace to continue or diÅ¿continue as God Å¿hall move and inable them. And much leÅ¿s let us Å¿uffer Å¿uch to live inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately, by livinge upon that taken from others, but rather let them live of their owne Meanes, or elÅ¿e apply themÅ¿elvs to worke. It is evell lookinge upon the Showe onely of Devotion, when vvithall, diÅ¿obediences to Gods holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, are Å¿uffered in them who make Å¿uch Showe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore, I now humbly petition your Å¿acred MajeÅ¿tie, that a Sufficiency beinge provided, for the true Cleargy of PariÅ¿hes, and for BiÅ¿hops and Arch-BiÅ¿hops, &amp; Å¿uch Cleargy as neceÅ¿Å¿arily neede in Offices under them: as alÅ¿o for our Cathedrall churches Å¿olemne Divine Service, and for our Schooles and UniverÅ¿ities: And laÅ¿tly, when our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h and Cathedrall churches are Å¿ufficiently provided of Adornements, aÅ¿well of the Temple, as of MiniÅ¿teriall veÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; then that People be Å¿taied from Offeringe any more unto the vvorke, Å¿ave onely as new Repayringe of thinges Å¿hall renewe occaÅ¿ion.</p>
                  <p>But becauÅ¿e experience hath declared, that the Cleargy beinge once Å¿ufficiently provided for, and made Å¿ure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyinge duringe life Å¿uch Maintenance, have growen laÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious of life, light of GeÅ¿ture, yea and negligent of Preaching the GhoÅ¿pell conveniently often, therefore I humbly peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a prevention, of this abuÅ¿e of yours and your Peoples Bounty. This prevention is no otherwiÅ¿e to be done, then by Å¿ubiectinge our Cleargy to danger, in caÅ¿e that upon being Å¿etled in a livinge, they then behave not themÅ¿elvs as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the MiniÅ¿ters of the GhoÅ¿pell. Our Church at hir givinge Orders hath taken Care hereof in hir Charge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150735:30"/>given to them who are Ordeined, and in takinge of them a Rynde of PromiÅ¿e Å¿o to doe; but the faile is, that afterwards they not doinge Å¿o, the Reporte of the PariÅ¿hioners is not hearkened unto, unleÅ¿s Å¿ome formall AccuÅ¿ation Å¿econd the Å¿ame. Under this Sheild our Cleargy are Å¿o carcleÅ¿s to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Showe of GodlineÅ¿s and HolineÅ¿s, that rather they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the contrary, even to a Showe of licentious Liberty. Truly when I Å¿awe the very Showe of Sanctity which PopiÅ¿h PreiÅ¿ts make, and marked the effect and power even thereof in the people, I wiÅ¿hed the true Sanctity of Å¿ome of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in them, &amp; their Showe of Sanctity in all our Divines: for the very Showe of Devotion and Sanctity in PreiÅ¿ts, as it anÅ¿wereth to the holy Offices they hold, and profeÅ¿Å¿ion they make, Å¿o it is not in vaine to the people of God, but rather is a Light and example unto them. For this cauÅ¿e I here peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the voice of the PariÅ¿hioners concerninge their Cleargy may be hearkened after, as a Meanes to come to the knowledge of the lightneÅ¿s, or evell Manners of their Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: For Men are loath to be AccuÅ¿ers in Courts of IuÅ¿tice, when yet in faithfulneÅ¿s, and with true Charity towards Gods Church, they cann Å¿ee, and Å¿einge mourne for, the LightneÅ¿s, laÅ¿civiouÅ¿neÅ¿s, LooÅ¿eneÅ¿s, and evell diÅ¿poÅ¿ition and Manners of their Cleargy.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it were good, that our BiÅ¿hops bounde our Divines, to the uÅ¿inge of religious exerciÅ¿es &amp; dutyes in their familyes, Å¿uch as are Morninge and Eveninge Praier, Grace before and after Meare, Readinge the Scriptures by them of their houÅ¿ehold by turnes, Repetition of Sermons, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiÅ¿inge conveniently often; for hardly cann a Man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve in his family theiÅ¿e things, but it will bynde him to have a care of his owne Manners and ConverÅ¿ation, that it be not in his family, nor abroade in Company, otherwiÅ¿e then Godly and Religious. We have Å¿eene the lamentable
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150735:31"/>effects of Riches and Glory in the Cleargy, when Gods Princes and People havinge given bountifully unto them, and made Å¿uch Bounty aÅ¿Å¿ured alÅ¿o unto them to injoy the Å¿ame: for then the Cleargy have taken Liberty, to live li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouÅ¿ly, and ungodly. Neither cann we expect any other fruict of greate Revenews in Cleargy-Men, if Gods Princes awe them not with the Sworde, profeÅ¿Å¿inge the uÅ¿e of the Å¿ame againÅ¿t them, if they leave to be that which God by his vvorde requires them to be, and be that which Gods vvorde condemnes. Let us enrich our Cleargy, but let us not hurte them, either by an exceÅ¿s in Giving, or by leavinge the reines of their Manners wholy unto themÅ¿elvs. How greate hurte did thoÅ¿e two greate Emperors doe to the Cleargy, ConÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the greate, and Charles the greate, if the reporte of their Donations to the BiÅ¿hop of Rome be true? vvhat Blood have thoÅ¿e Lands occaÅ¿ioned the Å¿heddinge of? what bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s have thoÅ¿e poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions ingendred in the Cleargy of that city? By thoÅ¿e poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions cheifly, the Cleargy of that city grew not onely licentious, but alÅ¿o incorrigible; but it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth both the Cleargy and alÅ¿o the Church of God, when Gods Princes poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the Cleargy of Å¿uch meaÅ¿ure of poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, as that both they will be wicked, and alÅ¿o are able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the DiÅ¿cipline of the Sworde, if any Prince would in duty to God make uÅ¿e of it againÅ¿t them. Therefore of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience we of theiÅ¿e tymes may beware, that we poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s not the Cleargy of too large and indeede Superfluous Revenews, leaÅ¿t they growe the cleane contrary to that which the vvorde of God requires them to be. Yea to come neerer home, doe but looke upon our Å¿ilken Cleargy Å¿ince they have but felt the blaÅ¿t of the Princes favour, obÅ¿erve their lightneÅ¿s of GeÅ¿ture, boldneÅ¿s againÅ¿t all Men, liberty in Å¿peach, that I add not, laÅ¿Å¿iviouÅ¿neÅ¿s and luÅ¿Å¿full vvanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s. I Å¿peake of our yonger Å¿orte of Cleargy, who by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150735:31"/>are apteÅ¿t, and therefore firÅ¿t doe beginn a declination from Cleargicall HolineÅ¿s; but, have no eye at theiÅ¿e to marke and correct their abuÅ¿e of this Grace, and Å¿hortly, even when they grow older to Å¿upply the roomes of our BiÅ¿hops, you Å¿hall have a new a wicked BpiÅ¿copacy. Therefore I humbly pray your Å¿acred MajeÅ¿Å¿ie, not that you change from favouriuge, honoringe, and enriching our Cleargy, but onely that an eye may be had of them that they abuÅ¿e not this Grace, turning it into ungodly liberty: As alÅ¿o, that our clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy be enjoyned to uÅ¿e their family to religious houÅ¿ehold dutyes: and laÅ¿tly, that the reporte or Å¿ame of thoÅ¿e who are converÅ¿ant or neighbours with our Cleargy, may be hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after by our BiÅ¿hops, and occaÅ¿ion thereby taken, to have an eye at Å¿uch, whoÅ¿e light behayiour, looÅ¿eneÅ¿s of converÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lewdneÅ¿s of life, or neglect of holy family exerciÅ¿es, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares their corruption though the Å¿etled and tich livinges they enjoy.</p>
                  <p>If this be taken heede unto by our BiÅ¿hopps: if alÅ¿o your MajeÅ¿tie vouchÅ¿afe to be zealous herein, givinge alÅ¿o Power to your MiniÅ¿ters of your Kingedome to have a care of, &amp; an eye at theiÅ¿e things in the Cleargy neere them, then would I not Å¿eare any harme, by the moderate increaÅ¿e of your and your Peoples Bounty towards our Cleargy. With the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioninge vvhereof, I cloÅ¿e up this Chapter alÅ¿o, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to an other.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>From this Scripture I obÅ¿erve, That the Kinge did not onely take Care that there were Teachers, but alÅ¿o that thoÅ¿e Teachers teach the Peoplet yea he joyned his Princes in this Care, that in every City they Å¿hould Å¿ee, that the People be taught by their Teachers. I therefore obÅ¿ervinge in this Kingedome, that many-many PariÅ¿hes, either had no Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, or having Teachers, yet thoÅ¿e Teachers careleÅ¿sly taught the People, Preachinge the GhoÅ¿pell once a month onely for Å¿atisfyinge the Lawe, was moved to write that my Å¿horte and Zealous little vvrytinge, which firÅ¿t I exhibited to your facred hands at Theobalds; adventuringe now alÅ¿o, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue my petition in this vvritinge more at large. Neither would I have troubled your MajeÅ¿tie with this petition, if it were not evident to all Men, that neither leangth of tyme, nor crye of people, have prevayled over our Teachers to teach their People diligently. Neither have our BiÅ¿hops furniÅ¿hed each ParriÅ¿h with a Teachinge MiniÅ¿ter, neither have they puniÅ¿hed thoÅ¿e, who cann teach, but doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently often Preach unto the People. If your MajeÅ¿tie therefore, and your Princes aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them, that they may place Teachers where there are none, and may puniÅ¿h or remove Å¿uch as can teach, but doe not, or if at all, yet not conveniently often, you Å¿hall doe a holy vvork, &amp; Å¿hall greatly benefit the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150735:32"/>Church of God. Your MajeÅ¿tie hath good experience (bleÅ¿Å¿ed be God) but that out UniverÅ¿ities are not Å¿o barren as not to affoorde Teachers enough, &amp; alÅ¿o that your people are not Å¿o Å¿paring, as not to give largely (beÅ¿ides what of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity they give) to have a Teacher appointed uuto them; for many are the places in this Kingedome, vvhere beinge ill fitted with thoÅ¿e Å¿etled in the livings, they of their voluntary raiÅ¿e from amonge them a yearely Å¿tipend for a hired Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Seinge therefore Gods bleÅ¿Å¿inge is Å¿uch upon our UniverÅ¿ities: Å¿eing alÅ¿o your people are Å¿o well diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, pitty it vvere to force them to content themÅ¿elvs with a dumbe PreiÅ¿t Å¿o longe as he liveth. My petition therefore unto your MajeÅ¿tie is, that where one poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿eth the place who cannot Preach, and where any one poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿eth the place, who though he cann, yet doth not conveniently often Preach unto the people, there Å¿uch be removed from the livinge, havinge onely Å¿ome Å¿male yearily Å¿tipend allowed them, &amp; an other placed in the Å¿ame, who both cann and will Preach the vvorde conveniently often. Surely if Å¿uch were awed with hazard of the livinge, who though they cann, yet doe not preach conveniently often, this woulde provoake them to Å¿tudy harder, and with practiÅ¿e to attaine a Å¿acility in Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge, that Å¿o they may conveniently often Preach the vvorde: for, vve Å¿ee how carefull they are of all thoÅ¿e things, by which they Å¿hall hazard the loÅ¿s of their livinge. And is not Teachinge the very Å¿peciall Duty of a Teacher vvhat therefore Å¿hould rather hazard the loÅ¿s of his livinge then a Negligent Teachinge? If it be now demanded, what I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt conveniently often, I anÅ¿were, once upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth day, if not twice; for uuly, Monthly Sermons Å¿erve not, cither for the Å¿ufficient inÅ¿tructinge of people in the Divine MyÅ¿teries, or for the reprooÅ¿e of their evellManners. Alas (my Lord) if the vvorde preached be appointed for a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150735:33"/>Soule-food, cann the Soules of Men be fed with Monthly Sermons? but your MajeÅ¿tie is not ignorant, that in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-PariÅ¿hes, Å¿uch is the backwardneÅ¿s of people to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tande and conceave the MyÅ¿teries of religion neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Silvation: Å¿uch alÅ¿o, not the rudeneÅ¿s onely, but the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of diÅ¿poÅ¿ition concerninge Manners, that it muÅ¿t be no Å¿male labour to inÅ¿truct them in the one, and to Reforme them by Religion in the other. Teachinge is not barely the leavinge a Sermon with a company of people, but it is the fittinge the vvorde to the preÅ¿ent NeceÅ¿Å¿ityes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; therefore alÅ¿o he that will be a good PaÅ¿tor or Teacher, muÅ¿t have his eyes and cares abroade amonge his PariÅ¿hio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to obÅ¿erve what they are ignorant in, &amp; what erronious opinions any fall into, and what their life and converÅ¿ation uÅ¿ually is, and whither in their familyes they uÅ¿e or neglect religious dutyes, for, who Å¿o doth not this, as he cannot well knowe the NeceÅ¿Å¿ityes of his PariÅ¿hioners, Å¿o alÅ¿o he knowes not to fit the vvorde to the occaÅ¿ions. But becauÅ¿e, cither the antient may be ignorant in Å¿ome points of Religion very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to their Salvation: or becauÅ¿e the ignorant youth growes dayly in each ParriÅ¿h or becauÅ¿e they vvhich knowe religious MyÅ¿teries neede incouragement and confirmation in them: or becauÅ¿e Satans temptations, and the corruption of Manners is never idle, but dally aÅ¿Å¿aults the people, to drawe them either to neglect the worde, or not to obey and obÅ¿erve it in their life and converÅ¿ation, therfore there is neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Preachinge the vvorde once at the leaÅ¿t every Sabbaoth, and Monthly Sermons Å¿uffiÅ¿e not. That kynde of Preachinge vvhich takes a text at random, and onely in largeth a diÅ¿cours as it gives occaÅ¿ion, is but a kinde of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Preachinge, vvhich may fit all places; but PaÅ¿torall Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge needeth a reÅ¿pect to the occaÅ¿ions of the ParriÅ¿h. Vaine vvere phiÅ¿ick if it reÅ¿ted onely with a generall decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150735:33"/>what is good for Å¿uch and Å¿uch diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, and did not moreover deÅ¿cend to perticuler diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed PerÅ¿ons, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as the NeceÅ¿Å¿ityes require; even Å¿o is it alÅ¿o vvith Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Who vvould coumpt him a good Shepheard, who though he knowes and cann declare all diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, &amp; all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies pertayninge to Sheepe, yet applies not each remedy as any diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed Sheeps gives occaÅ¿ion? It is therefore a defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Teachinge, where either the PaÅ¿tor is ignorant of the Å¿pirituall diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of his people, or knowinge them, yet fits not the vvorde of God unto them, or havinge onely done that, leaves to Å¿econd the Preachinge, with the Power and DiÅ¿cipline of Rule and Goverment. Alas, how Å¿male effects of the vvorde preached fynde we, vvhere the PaÅ¿tor havinge Taught his people, hath no Power nor Authority further, to judge and puniÅ¿h the diÅ¿obedient.</p>
                  <p>And indeede what other fruict or Å¿ucceÅ¿s cann we expect, while we Å¿ever that which God joyned togeather? for he joyned eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Power of ludgement and PuniÅ¿hment with the miniÅ¿tration of the worde. Let us but looke into Å¿everall PariÅ¿hes, where ludgement &amp; PuniÅ¿hment doe not accompany the worde preached, but the PaÅ¿tor reÅ¿ts vvith his leavinge a Sermon onely, and the people are left for matter of Goverment or Rule to the BiÅ¿hops Courte, and there let us obÅ¿erve, if the people be not Å¿o careleÅ¿s of the vvorde once hearde, that they care not of all the vvecke after, either to thinke any more of it, or to reforme themÅ¿elvs in any one thinge by it. Hence partly it is, that where there is every Sabbaoth day Teachinge, yet the People remaine as unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tianly in their converÅ¿ation, as if they never heard the word of God at all; though indeede in Å¿ome few places, the earneÅ¿t zeale of the Preacher, prevailes over the people to take the more heede, &amp; the more conÅ¿cionably to obÅ¿erve the things Preached; but yet even there it is evident, what a defect there
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150735:34"/>is of Rule to accompany the Preachinge. Neither let us thinke that the Churches Rule and DiÅ¿cipline, Å¿hould not Å¿treatch unto the very converÅ¿ation or Å¿peach of Men, Å¿einge the GhoÅ¿pell reÅ¿ts not with actions onely, but Å¿treatcheth its Å¿eife unto Mens Speaches alÅ¿o; therefore vve reade, EpheÅ¿. 4, 29: Let no corrupt communication proceede out of your mouths: and verÅ¿e, 31: Let all evell Å¿peakinge be put avvay from you. And chap. 5, 3: All uncleaneÅ¿s, let it not be once named among you, neither filthineÅ¿s, neither fooliÅ¿h talking, neither jeÅ¿tinge, which are thinges not comely.</p>
                  <p>TheiÅ¿e and many the like precepts the GhoÅ¿pell gives to Men even concerninge Speach, neither are theiÅ¿e to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted as bare CounÅ¿ailes, but rather as Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the DiÅ¿cipline of the Church Å¿hould correct in the diÅ¿obedient. True it is, that the GhoÅ¿pell Å¿treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth alÅ¿o to the affections, yea to the very thoughts of Men, when yet the Churches DiÅ¿cipline cannot Å¿treatch to Å¿uch things alÅ¿o; but yet becauÅ¿e DiÅ¿cipline is ordeyned for things that come fourth of Men, therefore it ought to Å¿econd aÅ¿wel the Precepts concerninge Speach, as the precepts concerning Actions of DrunkenneÅ¿s, Fornication, Adultery, Theft, or Idolatry. Though the Lawes of Kingedomes therefore, Å¿treatch not to filthy Å¿peakinge, to puniÅ¿h it vvhere it is uÅ¿uall, yet the Churches DiÅ¿cipline ought to Å¿treatch even to it.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore (Dread Soveraigne) I now humbly pray, that Å¿uch Teachers may be appointed PaÅ¿tors of our ParriÅ¿h churches, as who not onely reprove corrupt Communication by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge, but alÅ¿o Rulinge according to the Doctryne Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, doe take notice of unchriÅ¿tian Communication in their PariÅ¿hioners, joyninge vvith the Rulinge Elders of the ParriÅ¿h, both in callinge Å¿uch to Accoumpt, and in judginge the Å¿ame, and puniÅ¿hinge Å¿uch as continue Å¿till in that diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150735:34"/>not with Å¿tandinge any exhortation or warninge given. This is truly to feede the flock: this is truly to Teach; therefore if your Princes by commiÅ¿Å¿ion from you, doe in their Å¿everall abidinges or dwellinges, obÅ¿erve in the Cleargy the Neglect hereof, and leave it not to the BiÅ¿hop onely to call Å¿uch Cleargy to accoumpt, but doe themÅ¿elvs (the BiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hop not proceedinge after Å¿ufficient Notice, againÅ¿t Å¿uch Cleargy) proceede againÅ¿t them, executinge as your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters your Power in the reprovinge and puniÅ¿hinge of Å¿uch, then would the Cleargy of our Land be awed, &amp; your people would Å¿urely be diligently and proffitably Taught. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I petition your MajeÅ¿tie, that the Care hereof be not left to our BiÅ¿hops and Cleargy onely, but that your Princes, IuÅ¿tices, and other MagiÅ¿trates, may in places remote from your Princely preÅ¿ence, have alÅ¿o authority to Å¿ee to the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge of the People, and to the Cleargyes executing, both concerninge Teachinge alÅ¿o &amp; Rule, their true Dutyes &amp; Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in every of our PariÅ¿h Churches.</p>

Then Hezekiah the Kinge, and the Princes, commanded the Levits to praiÅ¿e the Lord with the wordes of David, and of AÅ¿aph the Seer.

And Hezekiah Å¿pake comfortably unto all the Levits, that had knowledge to Å¿inge unto the Lord.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>From theiÅ¿e Scriptures I gather Å¿pecially theiÅ¿e fower thinges: 1: That in tyme of peace and proÅ¿perity, the Lords vvorÅ¿hip may be increaÅ¿ed in MagnificenÅ¿e: 2: That the King tooke care, of the Å¿olemne, Stately, and right perfourmance of the Å¿ame: 3: That thoÅ¿e vvho have the Arte in Å¿onge, and in MuÅ¿ick, vvere cheriÅ¿ hed by the Kinge: 4: That the Kinge tooke care of, and Å¿urthered, the Peoples reÅ¿orte unto the Å¿ame.</p>
                  <p>It is truly vvorthy our obÅ¿ervation, that unto the Manner of Divine Service ordeyned in the vvilderneÅ¿s, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150735:35"/>of the Additions of Kinges and Prophets, made in lymes vvhen the Church vvas in Peace and ProÅ¿perity: For here vve reade of the vvords of David, and AÅ¿aph the Secr: alÅ¿o, of the InÅ¿truments of David Kinge of IÅ¿raell; neither of which lived in the tyme when the Church was in the vvilderneÅ¿Å¿e. If therefore God approved of this Addition, vvhich made in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure a change of the former Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Divine Service, why Å¿hould we under the ChriÅ¿tianity thinke, that the increaÅ¿e of the Magnificence of the vvorÅ¿hip of God is not acceptable? They are therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, who contend againÅ¿t the MagniÅ¿icent Manner of Divine Service, ordeyned by Gods Kinges and PreiÅ¿ts, and not diÅ¿Å¿onant from his former reveiled will, vvhich we fynde eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in the ChriÅ¿tian Church, after the Kinges and Princes embraced the ChriÅ¿tian faith. Neither ought any to thinke, that Kinges being converted to God, they have not a Å¿peciall prerogative in orderinge the Å¿et forme of Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>I graunte, they are not left wholy at Liberty to doe what pleaÅ¿errh them; for I noted before in the firÅ¿t chapter, that the Comandement vvas by the hande of the Lord, and by the hande of his Prophets; but yet this I Å¿ay, that under the ChriÅ¿tianity, where we have not new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations for all things, there the Kinge and Gods PreiÅ¿ts have power, to order the Manner of the Divine vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hipp, Å¿o as they doe nothinge in SubÅ¿tance againÅ¿t the vvill of God already reveiled. They may indeede under the Å¿heild of this liberty, bringe in many vaine and nnÅ¿eemely thinges; but vve truÅ¿t to Gods Å¿tronge hande over them.</p>
                  <p>And if they be Å¿o ill mynded, yet vvee neede not doubt, but that the Lorde vvill in due tyme diÅ¿cover their evell, and raiÅ¿e up redreÅ¿s for his CHVRCH,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150735:36"/>by the hands of more faithfull Servants. In the meane tyme, if they commande things, which in themÅ¿elvs are not againÅ¿t the vvorde of God reveiled, we are Å¿afer in obeyinge, then reÅ¿iÅ¿tinge. I approve not therefore of thoÅ¿e, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouÅ¿ely Å¿peake of the Å¿olemne Service of our Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Churches, Å¿peakinge rather their owne Å¿ingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, then that which hath any Å¿ounde warrant from the vvorde of God.</p>
                  <p>TheiÅ¿e things conÅ¿idered, I now for this matter conclude, That God is to be bleÅ¿Å¿ed, for your MajeÅ¿ties Iudgement and vviÅ¿edome, in retayninge Å¿till under the Reformation, the Magnificent Manner of Gods Divine vvorÅ¿hipp uÅ¿ed in our Cathedrall churches, and in Å¿ome few other places; for, Å¿einge the Å¿ame was ordered by former Princes and BiÅ¿hops, it was fit to be retayned, Å¿ave onely vvherein vve have direct vvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by the vvorde of God, or by evidence of evell, to alter &amp; Reforme the Å¿ame: for vve owe a Reverence to that vvhich former MiniÅ¿ters of God have ordered, Å¿ave in things which either are directly againÅ¿t Gods vvorde, or which carry vvith them an evidence of evell. But now, as on the one hande I bleÅ¿Å¿e God, for your MajeÅ¿ties continuinge the Stately vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip of God in our Cathedrall Churches, Å¿o on the other hande I humbly pray, that I may make two petitions: the firÅ¿t, That the peoples underÅ¿tandinges may be more yet ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered then hitherto it hÃ th bene: the Å¿econd: That the Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge Men, and others imploied in any Service, may be taken care of, that they be of an honeÅ¿t, religious, and holy life and ConverÅ¿ation.</p>
                  <p>For the better perfourmance of the firÅ¿t, it vvere good and proffitable, That vvhatÅ¿oever is Å¿unge or plaide in that Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Divine Service, be printed in bookes, that the Å¿ame may be read by the people, at the tyme of the Å¿inginge or playinge the Å¿ame in the Quire. Neither this onely, but it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150735:36"/>vvere alÅ¿o good that the people were inÅ¿tructed, both readily to knowe vvhat is Å¿unge or plaide, and alÅ¿o readily to turne to the Å¿ame in the booke vvhere they may reade it: yea, children Å¿hould be taught this in the Schooles; that Å¿o beinge trained up hÃ©rein, they may in their age reÅ¿orte proffitably to this Å¿olemne Service alÅ¿o Å¿ometymes, aÅ¿well as to their ovvne ParriÅ¿h Church ordinarily. For, (Dread Soveraigne) though charitably and religiouÅ¿ly, your PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors have cauÅ¿ed the Divine Service to be tranÅ¿lated into the EngliÅ¿h tongue, yet, partly, becauÅ¿e al that aÅ¿Å¿emble, cannot conveniÃ«tly aÅ¿Å¿emble in the Quire, (neither cann the Quire be altered, becauÅ¿e of the fittinge the Å¿ame to the voices of the Singers, that they may heare one an other): partly, becauÅ¿e Songe cannot be Å¿o diÅ¿tinct, as that the hearers can farr off diÅ¿cerne what is Å¿ung: partly, becauÅ¿e the MuÅ¿ick plaieth Å¿ome tymes alone in the Honour of God, vvhen yet Å¿ome thinge is, or ought to be intended, the tune whereof is with Arte of MuÅ¿ick plaide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one: and laÅ¿tly, becauÅ¿e the common Å¿orte are not Å¿kilfull in the Order, what is now Å¿unge, what then plaide; therefore, your people are even in theiÅ¿e tymes little better, then if the Service were perfourmed in a Å¿trange tongue. Herethrough cheifely it is, that your people doe not commonly Å¿o reÅ¿pect that Å¿olemne Service as they ought, neither indeede care at all to reÅ¿orte to the Å¿ame at any tyme; yea, and moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e that doe Å¿ometymes come to the Å¿ame, come neere onely vvhen Å¿ome thinge is read out of the Bible, or when thoÅ¿e Praiers are Å¿aid, which eaÅ¿ily they cann diÅ¿cerne and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tande; but when any thinge is done in Songe, or vvhen the MuÅ¿ick Å¿ilently plaieth, you Å¿hall then Å¿ynde them to retire themÅ¿elvs, and to give themÅ¿elvs to vvalkinge and talkinge. Others, of the yet Å¿impler Å¿orte of people, are (even as thoÅ¿e under Popery) pleaÅ¿ed vvith the tune onely, and delighted with the Å¿onge and MuÅ¿ick, and vvith the Å¿ight of the Stately

But as this evell in Gods people cannot but be diÅ¿pleaÅ¿inge to God, Å¿o Å¿urely if Å¿ome good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be not taken for redreÅ¿s hereof, it cannot but endanger the Lords acceptance of the very Service its Å¿elfe: for, it is not Å¿o much the Service vvherein a few vvorÅ¿hip, as the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip of many in Spirit that he regards.</p>
                  <p>Thus havinge vvritten of my firÅ¿t petition, I humbly pray, that I may proceede to the Å¿econd,</p>
                  <p>If onely Art be heeded in them admitted MiniÅ¿ters in the Divine Service, as if (Å¿o they be Å¿killfull, then) it matters not what their lives and converÅ¿ations be, then vvhen any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or irreligiouÅ¿ly diÅ¿poÅ¿ed PerÅ¿ons are admitted, we (from experience) cann hardly expect other, then that their unÅ¿anctified Soules will bringe fourth, as prophaneÅ¿s in their life and converÅ¿ation abroade, Å¿o irreverence and a meaÅ¿ure of prophaneÅ¿s in the very execution of their parts in the Divine vvorÅ¿hipp. But when people Å¿ee irreverence, or any meaÅ¿ure prophaneÅ¿s in the MiniÅ¿ters, it abates their devotion, and is no Å¿male Scandall to the Service its Å¿elfe. Therefore I humbly petition, that our BiÅ¿hops have not care that they reverently perfourme their parts in the Service onely, but alÅ¿o that they or the Deanes doe inquire of their life and converÅ¿ation abroade alÅ¿o out of the Church: for, if abroade in their howÅ¿es, or common company, they be wanton, laÅ¿civious or prophane, no Awe will Å¿erve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treine, that in the Service alÅ¿o their diÅ¿poÅ¿ition breake not fourth upon every little advantage or opportunity to Å¿hew the Å¿ame. If therefore our BiÅ¿hopps and Deanes Inquire after the common life and converÅ¿ation of Å¿uch what it is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150735:38"/>abroade out of the Church: if alÅ¿o they inquire whither in their familyes they uÅ¿e or neglect religious Dutyes, Å¿uch as are eveninge Praier at leaÅ¿twiÅ¿e, Grace before &amp; after meate, readinge the Divine Scriptures, Repeatinge of Sermons Å¿ome tymes, and Å¿ome tymes ChatechiÅ¿inge; then this would Awe them to exerciÅ¿e themÅ¿elvs to a HolineÅ¿s of life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation; EÅ¿pecially, if as they Å¿hall be founde conformable, or diÅ¿orderly, Å¿o they Å¿hall be admitted, or put by the Service. Yea it were good, that an exhortation were given to all, that if any of them knowe any amonge them, to be looÅ¿e and laÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious of Speach, prophane in converÅ¿ation, or negligent of religious Dutyes in their familyes, they Å¿hould informe the BiÅ¿hop or Deane of the Å¿ame, that Å¿o the party may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved, &amp; as occaÅ¿ion is given be proceeded againÅ¿t. Verily, it greately endangers the Service, both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, when the MiniÅ¿ters of the Å¿ame are knowen, to be wicked Men in their life and converÅ¿ation: for it cannot be but that the Lord Å¿hould turne his face, even from a good Service executed by Å¿uch, (if authority allowe Å¿uch to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters therein, as who commonly are knowen to be wicked of life and converÅ¿ation): Neither cann it be but that the people alÅ¿o, Å¿hould take Å¿uch offence at Å¿uch, as that even the very Service alÅ¿o Å¿hall well neere be Å¿orÅ¿aken.</p>
                  <p>If theiÅ¿e things therefore (Dread Soveraigne) be carefully Å¿eene unto, I nothinge doubt, but that our Divine Servico now uÅ¿ed in our Cathedrall Churches, will both be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God then heretofore, and alÅ¿o more conÅ¿ciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and religiouÅ¿ly then heretoÅ¿ote Å¿requented by your people. I may here add the like petition againÅ¿t our Clearkes of PariÅ¿hes, who commonly beinge of the lewdeÅ¿t of the PartiÅ¿h for life and converÅ¿ation, doe alÅ¿o Å¿o irreverently, unÅ¿kilfully, and unÅ¿eemely perfourme their Office, that the people of God cannot but take offence there
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150735:39"/>at, and this to the Å¿candall of the Service its Å¿elfe of out Church.</p>
                  <p>To conclude my Collections, together with my obÅ¿ervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s upon theiÅ¿e collected Scriptures, I now humbly petition, that as here it is Å¿aid, That the Kinge, and the Princes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp;c: Å¿o as in your PreÅ¿ence your Å¿elfe Å¿ee to theiÅ¿e things, Å¿o likewiÅ¿e in places remote from your Å¿acred PreÅ¿ence, your Princes and MagiÅ¿trats (by commiÅ¿Å¿ion from you) may have power and Authority to Å¿ee, that Divine Service be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted orderly and reverently throughout the Kingedome. So vvill our BiÅ¿hops and other EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Officers be the more carefull, that juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of reproofe be not given, not juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of your Princes and MagiÅ¿trates proceeding againÅ¿t any, for diÅ¿orders and unÅ¿eemely perfourmance of Dutyes.</p>
                  <p>THeiÅ¿e Collections (moÅ¿t mighty and Dread Soveraigne) I have made out of Å¿acred Scripture, thereby in Å¿ome Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall perticulets to Å¿hew, how Gods Kinges and Princes in that antient Church under the Lawe, tooke care of, and by their Authority ordered, even EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall things alÅ¿o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayninge to the Divine vvorÅ¿hip and Å¿ervice. Hereupon I have adventured to note unto your MajeÅ¿tic, diverÅ¿e weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perticulers, wherein this our Church of Englande needeth the redreÅ¿s of your powerfull hande. If therefore you vouchÅ¿afe to be aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant unto the Church of God in theiÅ¿e things, you Å¿hall Å¿urely bynde the Å¿ame unto you to hold your Memory bleÅ¿Å¿ed for ever: for, by orderinge theÅ¿e things, you Å¿hall both reÅ¿tore the Ordinances of God to his church, and diÅ¿poÅ¿e rightly the extents of our Cleargy IuriÅ¿dictions: you Å¿hall further the Preachinge of the GhoÅ¿pel in all places of this Lande, and alÅ¿o be the Meanes, not of a pompous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice onely, but of a Stately, Magnificent, Holy, &amp; Proffitable vvorÅ¿hipp of God. Which beinge done, it will be no leÅ¿s

                  <p>I neede not here prove from evidence of holy Scripture, that Kings and Princes under the ChriÅ¿tianity, are confirmed by God in the Å¿ame Offices which the Kinges under the Lawe executed, this I Å¿hall prove elÅ¿ew here, where I have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion to write of this Å¿ubiect to thoÅ¿e, who as yet are Å¿o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded of Papall leaÅ¿ings, that they acknowledge not the Å¿ame; but your MajeÅ¿tie profeÅ¿Å¿inge your knowledge hereof, and practiÅ¿inge in your Kingedomes accordinge to Å¿uch know ledge, I neede but to certify of Å¿ome things only, which even to this day neede redreÅ¿s in this our church of England. If it be obiected that I move unto Changes, &amp; that Changes are ever dangerous in Kingedomes, I then humbly pray your MajeÅ¿tie to conÅ¿ider, that I move to no Changes but Å¿uch, as which the evidence of the will of God in Seripture witneÅ¿Å¿eth unto. And what the Glory of Changes made under the Reformation, accordinge to the vvorde of the Lord in Scripture hath bene, the whole worlde now Å¿eeth, &amp; your MajeÅ¿tie enjoyeth and inheriteth the Glory and Power of the Å¿ame.</p>
                  <p>DoubtleÅ¿s, without a greate Change, and the Å¿ame very Å¿trange &amp; dangerous, we had had no Reformation of thinges; if therefore Gods vvorde hath made us happy in overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge the dangers of the greater Change, Å¿hould we neglect the yet further Conforminge of things to the vvorde, for feate of the danger of the leÅ¿Å¿er Change? I beÅ¿eech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿tie therefore, that you will Å¿o tender the Good of the Church of God, as that no feare of the danger of a Change, may hinder the yet further conforminge of things, to the evidence of the vvill of God as vve fynde it in holy Scripture.

                  <p>EXperience hath declared, that the Kingedome of Heaven hath increaÅ¿ed, and Sathans Kingedome decreaÅ¿ed, by the GhoÅ¿pells beinge MiniÅ¿tred by Men, vvho have an inÅ¿eazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spirit of God; therefore every childe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, as he loveth the prevaylinge of the one, &amp; declyninge of the other Kingedome, Å¿o he is to love, cheriÅ¿h and Å¿uÅ¿teine to his Power, Å¿uch MiniÅ¿ters of the vvorde, as have cvidence of an inÅ¿eazoninge of the Spirit of God.

                  <p>Some are admitted MiniÅ¿ters in the Church of Englande, vvho neither by the Spirit, nor yet of induÅ¿trious Study cann Preach at all; therefore they content themÅ¿elvs to reade Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service onely, or at the moÅ¿t to reade Å¿ome tymes a Homily to their PariÅ¿hioners.

                  <p>No Morninge or Eveninge Praier, Å¿carce Grace before and after meate, little or no Readinge of the Scriptures, No repetition of Sermons, nor any CatechiÅ¿ing throughout the yeare. As for your People in Å¿uch PariÅ¿hes, you Å¿hall commonly fynde them ignorant in Divine MyÅ¿teries neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to Salvation: CareleÅ¿s to knowe them at all: Swearers, Drinkers, IeÅ¿ters, filthy Å¿peakers, and in a vvord, vvithout any Showe of true GodlineÅ¿s, Å¿ave onely that to Å¿atisfy the Lawe, they reÅ¿orte on Å¿undaies to the Readinge of Divine Service; but there, neither caringe to marke oughts for their inÅ¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor comminge away, to be oughts at all bettered in life or converÅ¿ation.</p>

Alas, what evidence of the Spirit of God in Å¿uch PaÅ¿tors? vvhat prevayling is here of the Kingdom of heaven? Doth not the Kingdome of Sathan rather prevaile in Å¿uch PariÅ¿hes? verily (my Lord, and Kinge) you Å¿hall fynde under Å¿uch PaÅ¿tors as now I write of, the rudeÅ¿t, ignoranteÅ¿t, and wickedeÅ¿t of your people; therefore my humble petition is, that for the bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of your people in Å¿uch places, and for removinge a Å¿candall from our Church, Å¿uch unpreachinge PaÅ¿tors enjoy
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150735:41"/>not vvholy the livings, but rather be put to Å¿ome Å¿male Å¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and the reÅ¿idue beÅ¿towed on Å¿ome other who cann Preach the GhoÅ¿pell. I grante that Homily-readinge is not wholy without uÅ¿e in Å¿uch PariÅ¿hes; but yet no Divines but will confes, that Å¿kill in a PaÅ¿tor to divide the worde aright, as the NeceÅ¿Å¿ityes of the PariÅ¿hioners requires, is much to be preferd unto the Å¿ame: for though Homilyes conteyne excellent and Å¿ounde Doctryne, and are fraught with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian precepts, yet they are Å¿o generall, that vvithout a Å¿kilfull makinge uÅ¿e of the perticulers in a Homily, applyinge things to the preÅ¿ent NeceÅ¿Å¿ityes of the PariÅ¿ hioners, they cannot proffit the people, as doth a Å¿kilfull Sermon compoÅ¿ed by the Spirit in the PaÅ¿tor, and fitted to the occaÅ¿ions of the tyme and of PerÅ¿ons. For, in a PaÅ¿tor in Å¿eazoried with the Spirit of God, the Spirit aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ts in his choice, in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and directs him Å¿ecreately to the Doctrynes moÅ¿t prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the people of his Charge; therefore a Sermon Å¿o diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, is farr to be preferred before a Homily which is penned at random, Å¿ervinge generally for all places, and all people a like. But when the people feele not their owne ignorance met with, nor their owne knowledge confirmd, nor their owne Manners reprovd or commended, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no Power in that read unto them out of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Neither are Homilyes written to occaÅ¿ion in our Cleargy a Negligence of Study, but rather for the help of thoÅ¿e onely who cannot Preach Å¿oundly at all; therefore fart be it from our Church, to fetter a Congregation to a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily reader onely, if the tymes affoorde MiniÅ¿ters who cann divide the vvorde of the GhoÅ¿pell aright.</p>
                  <p>Thus having vvritten of one Å¿orte of MiniÅ¿ters, I humbly pray, that I may proceede to another.</p>
                  <p>Other MiniÅ¿ters there are, who though they cann, and doe Preach vvell, yet they preach as Å¿eldome as Lawe will permit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150735:42"/>them. Herewithall many of them are looÅ¿e of life &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane in ConverÅ¿ation. Yea they are common pot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: they Å¿erve as jeÅ¿ters at great Mens tables: and make no conÅ¿cience of their Speach, Å¿o as they may gaine a Meales meate in Å¿uch company of Credit. In a vvorde, neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in their ConverÅ¿ation, nor commonly in their dealings with Men, they Å¿hew any Signes of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of mynde. If you examine their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, you Å¿hall fynde there as little exerciÅ¿e of religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, as in thoÅ¿e familyes where there is neither faith nor feare of God. In Å¿uch PariÅ¿hes the voice of the people is, That they have a ParÅ¿on that cann doe well if he would: that he is a good fellowe, and the like; but they cannot commned him, either for any painefull Preachinge, or for any evidence of Piety And according to his evel diÅ¿poÅ¿ition and example, Å¿o you Å¿hall commonly fynde the PariÅ¿hioners, to take all liberty in vvickedneÅ¿s, Å¿o farr fourth as they dare for the Law of your Kingedome. Here, what faith? vvhat Sanctification? vvhat feare of God? vvhat talke of religious thinges? here you may fynde Å¿ome duÅ¿ty Bibles in familyes, but they Å¿erve not for any uÅ¿e all the yeate longe, Å¿ave onely to carry to Church on Sundaies. Here, Å¿carce in any one family of the ParrriÅ¿h, you Å¿hall fynde, or Morninge, or Eveninge Prayer, the whole yeare thorowe: here, no Repetition of Sermons: no CatechiÅ¿ing of the family at any tyme; yea Å¿carcely Grace before or after meate. What evidence here then of the Kingedome of heaven? vvhat childe of that Kingedome would not mourne, to Å¿ee here Å¿o Å¿male fruicts of the GhoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? If it be obiected, that Morninge and Eveninge Praier, Readinge the Scriptures, Repeatinge of Sermons, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿inge of the family, are new taxes not laid upon Men by the GhoÅ¿pell, then I anÅ¿were, That theiÅ¿e dutyes are included either expreÅ¿sly, or by conÅ¿equence, in the Commandements
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150735:42"/>given us in the GhoÅ¿pell. Moreover, becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doe theiÅ¿e things, in whom the GhoÅ¿pell moÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayleth, therefore the not doing them Å¿ervs as a Signe, that there the GhoÅ¿pell prevailes not in people as it ought. LaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Å¿einge every family is a Charge, where Parents have Charge of Children, and MaÅ¿ters of Servants, therefore in every family there ought to be Å¿ome Religious exerciÅ¿es, by which faith and devotion may be furthered.</p>
                  <p>Another Å¿orte of MiniÅ¿ters there is, who both cann, and doe Preach vvell, yea and often, as every Sabbaoth day once; but though of the aboundance of their learninge, they leave excellent Sermons with their PariÅ¿hioners, yet, what comes of it they care not, neither ever looke after its takinge any effect at all. And for all their Preachinge, yet obÅ¿erve them in their life and converÅ¿ation, and you Å¿hal never heare them Å¿peake of religious things, longer then they are in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; for abroade, all the weeke and yeare after, their PariÅ¿hio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fynde that their talke is wholy of worldly matters, Å¿o that by true Signes the PariÅ¿hioners diÅ¿cover them to be wholy worldly mynded. Civilly courtious they are, but Men may eaÅ¿ely Å¿ee, that it Å¿prings but from Civility, not from Religion. TheiÅ¿e love their PariÅ¿hioners, but it is but becauÅ¿e they reape Proffit by them; not for that they fynde the GhoÅ¿pell and the Grace of God to prevaile in them. If you Å¿earch into the familyes even of theiÅ¿e, you may fynde commonly more Å¿tore of Bibles, and more uÅ¿e alÅ¿o made of them, then in the MiniÅ¿ters howÅ¿es of whom I have before vvritten; but yet here you Å¿hall fynde the uÅ¿e to bee, onely as for a vvearinge out of the tyme with readinge, vvhich elÅ¿e they could not at preÅ¿ent tell how to paÅ¿s away. Here you may fynde Graces before and after meate, &amp; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more civility in the family, &amp; more Å¿howe of Religion alÅ¿o then in the former MiniÅ¿ters howÅ¿es; but yet for Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150735:43"/>or Eveniuge Praier, Repetition of Sermons, or Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿inge, you Å¿hal hardly fynde theiÅ¿e things the whole yeare thorowe. As for the People in Å¿uch PariÅ¿hes, you Å¿hall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fynde them better diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, then in the PariÅ¿ hes whereof before I have written: they are commonly more Civill, and reÅ¿pective of their life and converÅ¿ation They reÅ¿orte with more reverence to the Church, and have more Å¿tore of Bibles then in the PariÅ¿hes before written of; but as for family exerciÅ¿es at home, Å¿uch as are Morninge or Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge Praier, Readinge the Scriptures at convenient tymes, Repeatinge of Sermons, or CatechiÅ¿inge, you Å¿hall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fynde theiÅ¿e things uÅ¿ed throughout the yeare. If you Å¿earch them more narrowly, you may fynde indeed Å¿ome good meaÅ¿ure of knowledge of Divine MyÅ¿teries; but as for faith, or Sanctity through the Spirit: as for any converÅ¿inge of things of faith: as for any joy of things hoped for, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the GhoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿te, you Å¿hall hardly fynde theiÅ¿e things in them, no nor Signes of them. Here we may thanke God, for the evidence of the prevaylinge of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven in this your Kingedome, and this by the Å¿ight of a Å¿ounde Divine Service, and Preaching, and peoples reÅ¿ortinge to the Church; but we cannot here rejoyce of that Kingedomes prevaylinge, in the hearts, lives, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations of your people.</p>
                  <p>I grante indeede (Dread Soveraigne) that it is no Å¿male matter, that the GhoÅ¿pell preÅ¿Å¿ed vvith your Royall Lawes, prevailes over Lords, and inferior Governours of familyes, Å¿o much as to bringe their familyes to the Church; neither indeede is it a Å¿male Power, that hath brought even this to paÅ¿s. Moreover, if Lords, and other Governours of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, uÅ¿inge their familyes to the Church, doe leave them therewithall to God, hopinge that the vvorde preached, and Gods Grace accompanyinge the Å¿ame, worketh in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150735:43"/>to make them inwardly good ChriÅ¿tians; not further uÅ¿ing their family publickly, to Morning or Evening Praier daily, or to a reading of the Scripturs thorow, every one his or hir part, at convenient tymes, or to Repeating of Sermons, or to CatechiÅ¿inge, yet we may not doubt, but that in every Å¿uch family there is one, or Å¿ome, in whom the worde of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and faith in God groweth in them accordinge hereto, and Å¿o herethorowe there is in that family a private prayinge, and a private reading the Scriptures, and private Meditations, and Å¿elfe-CatechiÅ¿inges; therefore alÅ¿o vve may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne or reproach all Å¿uch families, as wherein publiquely, (the family gathered togeather) there is not uÅ¿ually holy exerciÅ¿es perfourmed. But yet, becauÅ¿e the very Showe of GodlineÅ¿s is good, not onely for an evidence to PaÅ¿tors, of the prevailinge of Gods Grace in their PariÅ¿hioners, but alÅ¿o for examples Å¿ake to others, as Å¿ervinge to provoake or incite one family by another in the uÅ¿e of Å¿uch pious exerciÅ¿es and Showe of GodlineÅ¿s, it is very behoovefull, that families have their publick holy exerciÅ¿es at convenient Å¿eazons. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e who moÅ¿t uÅ¿e theiÅ¿e pious family exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿es, make Religion a wearineÅ¿s to their family, by Å¿o conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drawinge them (in every minute of tyme, wherein they worke not) to theiÅ¿e exerciÅ¿es, that they leave no time for their familyes recreation and refreÅ¿hment, by Å¿portinge, dancinge, uÅ¿inge exerciÅ¿es of Activity, or exerciÅ¿es of danger for animatinge them to valiancy, and other like.</p>
                  <p>Thus by an extreame, a vice growes, and this both to the hurte of the family, and alÅ¿o to the Å¿candall of the GhoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿te; for Å¿ome erroneouÅ¿ly conceavinge, that Religion cannot Å¿tande with Å¿uch things, they make their Children &amp; Å¿ervants dull, and Å¿lowe of motion, and unÅ¿it for the defence of the Kingedome and of the Church; and others thinkinge that the GhoÅ¿pell admits not Å¿uch things, make the GhoÅ¿pels
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150735:44"/>yoake heavier then the Lord would have it, and Å¿o make the people take offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce therat. Yea, Å¿om have raiÅ¿ed a reproach &amp; cauÅ¿ed themÅ¿elvs to be a by-worde, through their puttinge the bridle of their owne worde in peoples mouths, reÅ¿trey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge them in thinges which Gods vvorde reÅ¿treynes them not in: Å¿uch Men doe both themÅ¿elvs, and alÅ¿o the GhoÅ¿pell wronge. The Scriptures declare the Lord not to diÅ¿like, but rather to approve, of Å¿portinges, Gen. 26, 8, dancings, Exod. 15, 20, Iudges, 11, 34, 37, and of exerciÅ¿es of Activity, Iudges, 20, 16, 1. Chron. 12, 2; therefore none ought by a vvorde of their owne to reÅ¿treyn Gods people in Å¿uch things. Such Men would make conÅ¿cience to doe as David did, who for the reÅ¿cue of a Å¿heepe, would followe after a Beare, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Lion, but this expoÅ¿inge a Mans Å¿elfe to Å¿uch dangers even upon Å¿uch cauÅ¿es, the Scripture rather approves then condemnes. Surely the Scripture commendinge as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and Honor of Kingedomes, that there are Active, &amp; valiant Men in the Å¿ame, 1. Chron. 12, 1, it doth conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently allow of Å¿uch hazardous exerciÅ¿es as incyte &amp; move Men to a valiant expoÅ¿inge themÅ¿elvs to dangers; therefore the baitinge of Bulls, of Beares, and huntinge of vvilde BeaÅ¿ts and the like, are not to be condemned to be uÅ¿ed by Gods people. If any evell be done, or evell Speach hearde in the uÅ¿inge of theiÅ¿e things, let that indeede be reproved and puniÅ¿hed; but let not Gods people be debarred from the uÅ¿e of theiÅ¿e lawfull things, under pretence that Religion and HolineÅ¿s will not Å¿tande with Å¿uch thinges. Would God that they that uÅ¿e theiÅ¿e things, would Å¿ay, and reÅ¿olve, and profeÅ¿s, that Å¿einge God is gratious to allowe them to Å¿porte, to dance, to uÅ¿e exerciÅ¿es for Activity, and even unto danger for animatinge of them to valiancy, therefore he Å¿hould not be diÅ¿honored by any in the uÅ¿e of them; for Å¿urely if Gods people did this, the Lord would delight in his peoples exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿inge
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150735:44"/>themÅ¿elvs in theiÅ¿e things. True it is, Mans corrupt nature is Å¿uch, as that hardly it cann uÅ¿e theiÅ¿e things without takinge Liberty with all, both to forget God, and alÅ¿o to put away his feare, in the tyme of their makinge uÅ¿e of theiÅ¿e things; but if MaÅ¿ters of families, and publick Governours, as alÅ¿o their PaÅ¿tors, would teach them frequently to minde the Lord, and to have care in their hearts not to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e him in their uÅ¿inge theiÅ¿e things, as alÅ¿o would be ready to reprove and puniÅ¿h any, that Å¿hould diÅ¿honor God in the tyme of the uÅ¿e of theiÅ¿e things, then the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be kept downe herein as in other things hereby: for the Awe of Goverment changeth the Manners, which a depraved Nature is apt to bringe fourth. And why Å¿hould not every one of every family thinke with themÅ¿elvs, that as to doe or Å¿ay oughts in their Å¿portinges, one with another, or family with family, or neighbours vvith neighbours, vvhich vvould diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e their MaÅ¿ters, and alÅ¿o their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trats, knewe they thereof, were the next way to be deprived of theiÅ¿e Solaces and RefreÅ¿hments, Å¿o to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e God, is likewiÅ¿e the next way to make him alÅ¿o to deprive them of them, and to plague the Land and them? Therefore people Å¿hould uÅ¿e theiÅ¿e things as by Gods permiÅ¿Å¿ion, havinge an Awe of God in their hearts, not to permit or doe any thinge in the uÅ¿e of them, which is truly a breach of any of Gods Commandements.</p>
                  <p>As for the Sabbaoth day, vvhereas Å¿ome uÅ¿e exerciÅ¿es of violence unto Blood, Å¿uch as are baiting of bulls, or beares cudgell playinge, &amp; other like, theiÅ¿e, though they be lawfull at other tymes, yet not on the Sabbaoth; more harmeleÅ¿s Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces &amp; delights befits the Å¿ame, both for conveniency, &amp; alÅ¿o for that it is a reÅ¿t, aÅ¿well to BeaÅ¿ts as to Men: the like I might Å¿ay for hobby-horÅ¿es, and men in vvomens apparell (but this indeede unlawfull) vvhich our Maygaimes commonly uÅ¿e;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150735:45"/>for, even in indifferent things, there may be a fitneÅ¿s not to uÅ¿e them on the Lords Sabbaoth day. TheiÅ¿e things I thought good to touch at here, becauÅ¿e men are apt to erre by an erroneous reÅ¿treinte, aÅ¿well as by an erroneous liberty-takinge. Againe, I finde in thoÅ¿e who moÅ¿t uÅ¿e holy and religious dutyes, a cuÅ¿tome of long prayinge, as if they would make a cuÅ¿tome, or get a Name for great prayinge; whereas the Lord doth in Scripture declare himÅ¿elfe, to delight in Å¿horte praiers, tendinge to the preÅ¿ent occaÅ¿ions of praying, vvhich alÅ¿o are fitteÅ¿t for the Spirits attendance thereto, and to be made in faith of that praied for. There is no truth in praier, when the Spirit, and faith, accompany not the things praied for; neither cann they conveniently accompany longe and tedions praiers. In Congregations indeede, there muÅ¿t be in the PaÅ¿tor a Å¿ence of, and praier for publick offences &amp; Benefits, and the very rehearÅ¿ing of many perticulers is there truly needefull; but in the private family, the occaÅ¿ion of the prayinge, vvhither it be for the morninge or eveninge is eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to be tendered, though Å¿om other perticulers for the common wealth may alÅ¿o breifely be remembred.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I noted Å¿ome evells, whereinto Å¿ome the moÅ¿t devoute, are apt to fall, that Å¿o Å¿uch evells may be prevented; but yet if this Care be taken againÅ¿t theiÅ¿e evells, it would be very proffitable that every family aparte uÅ¿e its Å¿elfe to Å¿uch Religious Dutyes. For, for vvant of accouÅ¿tominge a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily hereto, vve fynde that Men goinge to church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge from thence, make that all their Religion for all the vveeke after; never thinkinge any more of any thinge lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Church, nor caringe to doe in the vveeke, as they vvere at Church taught to doe; vvhereas if at home the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily vvere uÅ¿ed to theiÅ¿e pious exerciÅ¿es, it would occaÅ¿ion a makinge conÅ¿cience to reÅ¿orte to Church, and there to vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hipp God vvith faith in the Spirit, aÅ¿well as in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150735:45"/>GeÅ¿tures of the Body: as alÅ¿o it would make them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of that taught, to remember a parte, and Å¿ome Å¿peciall things, either to Beleeve them heartily, or to practiÅ¿e them in their Actions and Speach all the tyme of their life: for Å¿ome things are to be Beleeved onely, other things are to be practiÅ¿ed, and in both every hearer ought to be carefull, that he doe it as he is taught by the GHOSPELL of CHRISTE.</p>
                  <p>Thus havinge vvritten of Å¿ome Å¿orts of MiniÅ¿ters, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved unto your MajeÅ¿tie the effects of their defects in your People, I now humbly pray, that I may proceede to vvrite alÅ¿o of thoÅ¿e other MiniÅ¿ters, in vvhom I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, bleÅ¿Å¿inge God alÅ¿o for them, and for the rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Fruicts, of their zealous and painefull MiniÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Other MiniÅ¿ters there are in this Church of Englande, who beinge learned, are alÅ¿o painefull Preachers of the word. They preach once at the leaÅ¿t, but ordinarily twice on the Sabbaoth day, if not once in the weeke dayes alÅ¿o. TheiÅ¿e obÅ¿erve their PariÅ¿hioners, whither uÅ¿ually in their life and converÅ¿ation, they bringe fourth any Fruicts of their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge. TheiÅ¿e vvatch over any erroneous opinions in their PariÅ¿hioners, informinge them better, and Å¿tayinge their outÅ¿preadinge. TheiÅ¿e watch alÅ¿o over the Manners of their PariÅ¿hioners, aÅ¿well their converÅ¿ation as their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, obÅ¿ervinge vvhen they are either vitious or vertuous. TheiÅ¿e apply themÅ¿elvs to fit their Preaching alÅ¿o unto theiÅ¿e obÅ¿ervations, uÅ¿inge Comminations or ConÅ¿olations as the peoples vices or vertues, neglect or obÅ¿ervation of Doctryne gives occaÅ¿ion. Which that they may the better doe, they obÅ¿erve &amp; marke the common fame that goes of any in the ParriÅ¿h, and herewithall they have their eyes and eares abroade in the ParriÅ¿h, even faithfull and godly Men, vvho
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150735:46"/>obÅ¿ervinge the common converÅ¿ation and dealings of their Neighbours, doe faithfully informe them how they fynde their Neighbours commonly diÅ¿poÅ¿ed: whither to obÅ¿erve religiouÅ¿ly what is Taught them, or to neglect to obÅ¿erve the Å¿ame. All this they doe, before any of their PariÅ¿hio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners come to Å¿uch height of iniquity, as to be publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿ed, and proceeded againÅ¿t in any courte of luÅ¿tice: Yea and hereby they Å¿o prevent peoples Å¿o offendinge that well neere, rather they by their well directed Doctryne, and grave or PaÅ¿torly Authority, then the feare of the PuniÅ¿hment which is by your Law to be inflicted, doe bridle and reÅ¿treine your people from offendinge your Lawes. TheiÅ¿e, in their owne familyes, uÅ¿e Morninge and Eveninge Praier, Grace before and after Meate, Readinge the Scriptures thorowe in time, every one of the houÅ¿ehold their turne or parte. TheiÅ¿e uÅ¿e their family to Repeatinge of Sermons, and alÅ¿o Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿e them conveniently often. If you talke with theiÅ¿e, you Å¿hall fynde them religiouÅ¿ly diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, affectinge alÅ¿o in all conference with Men, to leave Å¿ome Seedes and gratious impreÅ¿Å¿ions, either confirminge Men in the faith of Å¿ome Å¿peciall thinge of the GhoÅ¿pell, or dehortinge them from Å¿ome wickedneÅ¿s to which they are (by reporte) inclyncable. TheiÅ¿e are religiouÅ¿ly courteous, and affable, lovinge their PariÅ¿hioners, not for their owne private gaine they have by them onely, nor onely for neighbourhood and freindÅ¿hipp, but, (after the example of the ApoÅ¿tles) for the evidence of their faith, and for the evidence of their receavinge carefully, and practiÅ¿inge conÅ¿cionably the worde of Life. TheiÅ¿e Å¿hew themÅ¿elvs by many apparant Signes, that they love and Å¿eeke the Salvation of their People, rejoycinge of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteable likelihood of many, and aÅ¿Å¿urance of Å¿ome, that they Å¿hall be partakers in the future Glorification. TheiÅ¿e are grave in geÅ¿ture, Å¿ober and meeke in converÅ¿ation: they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150735:46"/>are devoute: they are Holy: yea, a Man may by good Signes diÅ¿cerne, that from a Springe of faith in themÅ¿elvs they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte others unto faith, and from a Å¿ence of the Å¿weeteneÅ¿s of obedience in themÅ¿elvs, they incourage or animate others to obey the GhoÅ¿pell. In a worde, theiÅ¿e goe before their PariÅ¿hioners in thoÅ¿e things, vvhereunto by their Preaching they exhorte them. This for the MiniÅ¿ters themÅ¿elvs, and their familyes; now conÅ¿ider the people alÅ¿o under them. You Å¿hall fynde here the common voice of the PariÅ¿hio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be to this effect: We have, (God be bleÅ¿Å¿ed) a learned and a good Man to our Teacher: he taketh greate paines to teach us: he loves us: he is ready to inÅ¿truct and teach us, even in private conference, upon any Å¿cruple of conÅ¿cience: he is courteous even to the meaneÅ¿t of us, Å¿hewinge alÅ¿o by evident Å¿ignes, that he heartily deÅ¿ires the Salvation of our Soules. In theiÅ¿e PariÅ¿hes you Å¿hall fynde in the people, in the meaneÅ¿t aÅ¿well as in the greateÅ¿t, more knowledge in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine MyÅ¿teries, then in the PariÅ¿hes formerly written of. Here, more evidence of faith of thoÅ¿e holy MyÅ¿teries, and in God and in ChriÅ¿te accordinge to the direction of thoÅ¿e My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teries.</p>
                  <p>Here you Å¿hall fynde more Å¿tore of Bibles in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: more readinge in them: more proffit by readinge in them, then in the other PariÅ¿hes. Here, eveninge, if not morninge and eveninge Praier: Here, grace before and after Meate, and the Å¿ame done with Reverence alÅ¿o, and an evidence of faith, and feare of God. Here you Å¿hall fynde repeatinge of the Sermons at convenient tymes: Here, cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿inge alÅ¿o conveniently often. Here, the Neighbours will conferr Å¿ome tymes one with another, aÅ¿well of heavenly things as of vvordly: yea and this they vvill doe, not to Å¿hew what they cann Å¿ay of Å¿uch things, or to get a MaÅ¿tery in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but with a mutuall Hope for Å¿uch things, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150735:47"/>one another in the faith and eÅ¿teeme of Å¿uch things, animatinge one another to preferr them in their love and deÅ¿ire, before theiÅ¿e vvorldly things, which all men have and enjoy. When I Å¿awe this in Å¿ome, I rejoyced, as one who had founde Å¿ome who are anÅ¿werable to that exhortation of the ApoÅ¿tles, where he deÅ¿cribinge in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reÅ¿urrection of our Bodyes, 1.

Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s where people thus doe, as fit opportunity, and mutuall diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of myndes vvill Å¿erve, the Lord vvill drawe neere to heare their talke, openinge alÅ¿o their underÅ¿tandinges yet better, as we reade of him that he did, Luke, 24, 13.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in theiÅ¿e PariÅ¿hes vve fynde the People, not onely to reverence their PaÅ¿tor, but heartily to love him, beinge glad alÅ¿o to have occaÅ¿ion of doinge any thinge, whereby they may manifeÅ¿t the Love they beare him. Here, there is an abÅ¿tayninge from uÅ¿uall and unlavvfull Å¿wearing. Here you Å¿hall not fynde uÅ¿ually any exceÅ¿s in drinkinge, Here, no laÅ¿civiouÅ¿s, filthy, or beaÅ¿tly talke, no bold, luÅ¿tfull: and filthy geÅ¿tures; but rather you Å¿hall fynde here the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vertues, even an abÅ¿tinence from evell, and yet a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Love and delight as youth requires, but with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treinte of Å¿uch wicked exceÅ¿s. Here, in a worde, you Å¿hall fynde a comforteable Å¿hewe of GodlineÅ¿s: Here, a true evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ChriÅ¿tian life and converÅ¿ation. Here therefore is indeede, an evidence of the inÅ¿eazoninge and habitation of the Spirit of God, both in PaÅ¿tor, and People: Here a plaine evidence, both of the Kingedome of Heaven in Power, and alÅ¿o of the weakeninge, if not caÅ¿tinge out of the contrary Kingedome, even the Kingedome of Satan. Of theiÅ¿e Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters and PariÅ¿hes therefore I rejoice, and for your gratious favour towards them, for their better incouragement in well doing, I humbly petition your Å¿acred MajeÅ¿tie in this writing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:150735:47"/>But, Å¿ome, and too many of theiÅ¿e, are in the number of thoÅ¿e, whoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters are Å¿ilenced, and whoÅ¿e people are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with the nick name of Puritanes. My Lord and Kinge, I petition not that their errors be Å¿uffered; but this I petition, that the MiniÅ¿ters leaving their errors, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alÅ¿o forÅ¿akinge them, both MiniÅ¿ters and People may fynde you gratious towards them, by reÅ¿toringe the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters to their former MiniÅ¿tration, and by acceptinge the people as the Lights of our Lande for Religion. There is no Garden where vveedes will not growe; neither doe men deÅ¿troy the Garden for the vveedes Å¿ake, but rather vveede out the vveedes and preÅ¿erve the Garden Å¿till. We may not conceave, that none that are true ChriÅ¿tians, and have the Spirit, fal into any errors; for Peter had his error, Galat. 2, 11: and the Churches of Corinth &amp; Galatia had their Å¿trayinges from the truth, vvhen yet neither Peter was Å¿ilenced, but onely the error he fell into withÅ¿toode, nor thoÅ¿e Churches, forÅ¿aken, but onely the vveedes weeded out. And it is truly a harde thinge, that Mens MiniÅ¿teryes are wholy Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed, for an error or two in Iudgement, whereas rather firÅ¿t, they Å¿hould be but Å¿taied from Preachinge Å¿uch errors, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes upon obÅ¿tinate perÅ¿iÅ¿tinge, Å¿ilenced. But Å¿einge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our learned and painefull Divines, whoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿try hath bene very proffitable in this Church of Englande, are wholy for Å¿ome few errors Å¿ilenced, I am now a petitioner, that their MiniÅ¿tery may be reÅ¿tored, Å¿o as they forÅ¿ake thoÅ¿e things which truly are errors in them.

Surely (Dread Soveraigne) theiÅ¿e Congregations vvhere Å¿ilenced MiniÅ¿ters have bene, doe

I vvill not Å¿ay it is the fault of their Conformity, God forbid; but this I Å¿ay, it is the fault of their not exerciÅ¿inge like PaÅ¿torall dutyes, as the Å¿ilenced MiniÅ¿ters exerciÅ¿ed: and it is the fault of our BiÅ¿hops not preÅ¿Å¿inge them to exerciÅ¿e Å¿uch, but rather leavinge them to a prejudiciall Liberty in Life and ConverÅ¿ation.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I, (my moÅ¿t gratious Soveraigne) adventured, to Å¿et before your viewe, the diverÅ¿e diÅ¿poÅ¿itions of your People, according to the diverÅ¿ely diÅ¿poÅ¿ed MiniÅ¿ters Å¿et over them. I neede not now doubt of your MajeÅ¿ties quick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehention and diÅ¿cerninge, where in your Kingedome the Kingedome of Heaven moÅ¿t prevaileth, neither yet where are the beÅ¿t evidencyes of the Spirit of God. You have given Å¿uch Signes of your excellent judgement in theiÅ¿e things, that I rather rejoice thereof, then infourme you oughts at all.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that it is not rigour of PuniÅ¿hment, no nor Lawes, that vvill bring people on to theiÅ¿e holy exerciÅ¿es in their familyes, and to this bleÅ¿Å¿ed reÅ¿treinte from ungodly converÅ¿ation, Å¿o well as the vvorde of God frequently prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, &amp; wiÅ¿ely directed, by a Å¿kilfull MiniÅ¿ter Neither is there any expectation, that a vvhole People Å¿hould at an inÅ¿tant be brought to this meaÅ¿ure of conformity to the GhoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿te. Yet, if PariÅ¿hionall Goverment, might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany PariÅ¿hionall miniÅ¿tration of the vvorde, the people would doubtleÅ¿s the Å¿ooner be brought hereunto. Not that there Å¿hould be any violent diÅ¿gracinge, or proceedinge againÅ¿t all that preÅ¿ently are not conformable, (for this were to provoake untymely the people, before the Lords tyme for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150735:48"/>their converÅ¿ion be come) but that by little and little, with MeekeneÅ¿s and GentleneÅ¿s, the PariÅ¿hionall Governours drawe them on, to conforme themÅ¿elvs to the Rules of the GhoÅ¿pell. But, where any family is too obÅ¿tinate, refuÅ¿inge for longe tyme to exerciÅ¿e therein any religious dutyes, there I humbly pray, that your MajeÅ¿tie incourage the PariÅ¿hional Governours, to proceede on orderly againÅ¿t Å¿uch; for Å¿urely, a family that within its Å¿elf, doth wholy neglect all pions exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿es, is neere unto AtheiÅ¿me, yea though they obÅ¿erve cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tomarily their comminge to Church. This if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿tie vouchÅ¿afe to doe, you Å¿hall Å¿urely make your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall bleÅ¿Å¿ed for ever, even as is the memory of theiÅ¿e good Kinges bleÅ¿Å¿ed, of whom before I have vvritten. If it be obiected, that Tradition Å¿hews us no evidence, that ever at all the Church had Å¿uch a Goverment by Lay Elders alÅ¿o as which I now preÅ¿s, (for this is the difficulteÅ¿t Change I peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for) then I anÅ¿were; If we receave the Office of BiÅ¿hops &amp; Arch-BiÅ¿hops, becauÅ¿e Tradition brings them to us, when yet we have not any great vvarrant from Scripture, both for BiÅ¿hops and Arch-BiÅ¿hopps, (though indeede for one, Å¿et over Teachers and Churches we have great evidence) Å¿hall we not much more receave a Goverment by Lay Elders, vvhich hath evidence as I have before Å¿howen in Scriptures, yea though corrupted Tradition affoorde us no Light for Å¿uch? The Lord hath not given Å¿uch evidence to a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which hath aymed at the pureÅ¿t Tradition onely, as to that which hath aymed to Reforme things by his vvorde in Scripture; therefore to Conforme the Offices and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall, to that vvhich the Scripture gives us Light for, is Å¿urely moÅ¿t acceptable to God, and Å¿hall receave the greateÅ¿t bleÅ¿Å¿inges. Therefore I vvill conclude this my vvrytinge, firÅ¿t vvith a petition to your MajeÅ¿tie, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittinge of Å¿uch a PariÅ¿hionall Goverment, (having an eye
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150735:49"/>rather at the Ordinance of God, as we fynde it in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then at corrupted Tradition and its teÅ¿timony and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority): and Å¿econdly with my Praier to God: That he give you a hearte to execute his will, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h your Throane in the Church, continuinge your flouriÅ¿hinge Kingedomes to your Å¿elfe, and your poÅ¿terity for ever. For truly, our Church prayeth well, where it Å¿aith: Almighty God, whoÅ¿e Kingedome is everlaÅ¿tinge, and power infinite, have mercy upon the whole Congregation, and Å¿o rule the hearte of thy choÅ¿en Servante, Iames, our Kinge and Governour, that he, (knowinge whoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ter he is) may above all things Å¿eeke thy honour and glory: And that we his Subiects, (duly conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringe vvhoÅ¿e authority he hath) may faithfully Å¿erve, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp; humbly obey him, in thee, and for thee, according to thy bleÅ¿Å¿ed vvorde and ordinance, through IESUS CHRISTE our Lord.</p>
